       "               'Secretary ZInke:\\n\\nI have been exploring the area now known as the Bears Ears National Monument since April 1979. It is one of the most remarkable landscapes I know in the United States, perhaps even the world. I have had the good fortune to walk among the ruins of the Maya in the Yucatan and the Khmer in Angkor Wat. I have visited the ancient Buddhist monasteries of Upper Mustang in Nepal. The Ancestral Puebloan ruins of the Bears Ears National Monument are of equal beauty and importance, and you have the choice to preserve them or to allow them to be destroyed.\\n\\nThe Bears Ears National Monument is, quite literally, an outdoor museum where one can walk in the footsteps of the Ancestral Puebloans, visit where they lived, and encounter their material culture in situ. I have found large, beautifully decorated potsherds, projectile points, parts of yucca sandals, a piece of a rabbit hair blanket. I have marveled at these 800-year-old creations made by humans who went before, all in a place of breathtaking physical beauty and amazing geology. I have assisted friends who would otherwise be unable to visit perfectly intact backcountry kivas. I have known the wonder of exploration and have savored vistas that most Americans will never see. I have gazed upon the Milky Way on a moonless night in one darkest skies in America, Cedar Mesa, Utah.  \\n\\nI also have seen the wanton destruction done by the San Juan County, Utah Road and Bridge Department when they illegally bulldozed a road to Moon House Ruin in McCloyd Canyon using a bogus R.S. 2477 claim to rationalize their vandalism. I have seen the increase in visitation brought by this careless act that threatens the integrity of this unparalleled ruin complex. I have seen middens dug by hand and by backhoe. I have seen illegal ATV tracks and and picked up the garbage left behind by mindless yahoos. I have seen viga timbers ripped out of ancient structures and used for firewood. I have seen fragile walls toppled by careless visitors. I have seen piles of cow dung in the remains of sacred kivas. I have seen fragile desert waterholes fouled by cattle. \\n\\nI have seen a thousand very good reasons for the protections afforded by President Barack Obama\\'s designation of the Bears Ears National Monument to remain in place and intact. I implore you to not undo this remarkable national treasure to placate the noisy voices of extremism shouting in San Juan County, Utah, Salt Lake City and the halls of Congress. I ask you to come visit the heart of the Bears Ears backcountry. I would be happy to take you to places that would blow your mind and broaden your perspective, all away from the glare of TV cameras and the pressure of those who wish to destroy this place, those who shepherded you on your recent visit to Utah. \\n\\nPlease visit the monument personally and in depth, not just the rushed \"drive-by\" you did with the opponents of the Bears Ears National Monument. Walk its canyons, marvel at its amazing cultural resources, listen to the dulcet call of the canyon wren, and be in awe of God\\'s creation. \\n\\nThe shrill voices of the Utah Congressional Delegation and the misguided Governor Herbert should NOT carry more weight than that of the Native Americans whose tribes have deep cultural ties to this remarkable landscape. The decision comes with a heavy moral burden to FINALLY honor commitments made by the United States government and the sovereign tribal nations that revere the Bears Ears as a sacred place. I too share their reverence for the Bears Ears.\\n\\nI implore you to honor the commitments made to the five tribes that comprise the Bears Ears Intertribal Coalition, the Navajo, White Mesa Ute, Ute Mountain Ute, Zuni and Hopi. The utterly unique co-management agreement with these tribal entities should be honored, as well as the physical integrity of the Bears Ears National Monument itself.  \\n\\nYou have the opportunity to do the right thing. Please don\\'t choose the (perceived) politically expedient thing. Do the honorable thing that will preserve the Bears Ears National Monument for generations of Americans to come.\\n')]),\n",

I\\'ll let the great Theodore Roosevelt provide the foundation of my argument:\\n\\n\"Moreover, I believe that the natural resources must be used for the benefit of all our people, and not monopolized for the benefit of the few, and here again is another case in which I am accused of taking a revolutionary attitude. People forget now that one hundred years ago there were public men of good character who advocated the nation selling its public lands in great quantities, so that the nation could get the most money out of it, and giving it to the men who could cultivate it for their own uses. We took the proper democratic ground that the land should be granted in small sections to the men who were actually to till it and live on it. Now, with the water power, with the forests, with the mines, we are brought face to face with the fact that there are many people who will go with us in conserving the resources only if they are to be allowed to exploit them for their benefit. That is one of the fundamental reasons why the special interests should be driven out of politics. Of all the questions which can come before this nation, short of the actual preservation of its existence in a great war, there is none which compares in importance with the great central task of leaving this land even a better land for our descendants than it is for us, and training them into a better race to inhabit the land and pass it on. Conservation is a great moral issue, for it involves the patriotic duty of insuring the safety and continuance of the nation. Let me add that the health and vitality of our people are at least as well worth conserving as their forests, waters, lands, and minerals, and in this great work the national government must bear a most important part.\"\\n\\nDo the right thing, if you don\\'t you will be replaced by someone who will.

They were repeatedly asked to allow the people of the county to vote on the matter, but as soon as the congressional delegation (all one sided, and supported by the foundation that was seeking the designation) thought they could swing a deal with the Obama administration they went directly for the executive order path. I would be in favor of some portion of what was designated if thoroughly thought through. By this I mean the adjoining military lands, border lands, and lands that law enforcement can not currently access must be dealt with, along with a commitment or clause to revisit the whole idea periodically for dissolution or modification. Most of all if the people of the county who must live with the decision are allowed to vote on it, and a majority of the voters decide it is our best interest then it should be put in place. As it stands now it benefits no one, and has effectively closed huge swaths of land off to local residents, and law enforcement for that matter.

The following undersigned commenters are members and supporters of the Wilderness Society that responded to the following comment in support of Grand Staircase-Escalante and Bears Ears National Monuments in Utah and urging Secretary Zinke to leave all of our national monuments intact:\\n\\nDear Secretary Zinke,\\n\\nOur national monuments and public lands and waters help define who we are as a nation by telling the story of our historical, cultural and natural heritage. I am extremely disappointed that President Trump has signed an executive order that attempts to undermine our national monuments. Attempts to roll back protections for national monuments would be both illegal and terribly misguided. I strongly urge you to oppose any efforts to eliminate or shrink our national monuments.\\n\\nGrand Staircase-Escalante National Monument and Bears Ears National Monument in Utah are truly some of the treasures of our state. Bears Ears National Monument, which is first on the list for this \"review,\" is a textbook example of the priceless historic, cultural and natural wonders that are protected as national monuments. Protecting 100,000 archaeological and cultural sites, the monument honors the voices of five tribes who joined together to seek protection of their shared ancestral lands and traditions. Bears Ears National Monument should remain protected permanently.\\n\\nThe monument boundaries are based on the extensive cultural mapping and traditional knowledge of the Native American tribes to best protect the thousands of archaeological, cultural and sacred sites in the area as well as the incredibly wildlife habitat, serenity and scenic wonders that make up this incredibly landscape. Furthermore, the majority of Utahns agree that this area deserves protection, and the boundaries are essentially identical to those included in the legislation introduced by Congressman Bishop. Only when this legislation ultimately failed was the monument designated - as everyone agreed, this area deserved protection. Not only is Bears Ears National Monument incredibly worthy of protection, it is an incredibly vital part of the outdoor recreation economy in the state of Utah - protecting some of the best climbing locations in the entire state and country.\\n\\nPublic input and discussions of protections for Bears Ears National Monument have already been robust. Secretary Jewell held a public meeting in Bluff, UT, that was attended by over 1,400 members of the public and the majority were in support of this designation. According to recent polling, 80% of western voters support keeping existing national monument protections in place.\\n\\nGrand Staircase-Escalante National Monument is a geological, paleontological and scenic treasure unrivaled in the world. The slot canyons, arches and stunning features of the landscape as well as the peace and wonder it inspires - and the research and learning the paleontological resources have provided - demonstrate without a doubt that this monument is more than worthy of protection for the objects of history and scientific importance it protects. Not only that, but over the last 21 years, the monument has already demonstrated itself as an economic success, which is why the Boulder-Escalante Chamber of Commerce is unanimously in support of retaining the monument and its current boundaries. By a 2 to 1 margin, recent polls show Utah voters believe the protection of Grand Staircase-Escalante has been a positive development for the state. I urge you to maintain protections for this landscape, and to listen to all Utahns and all Americans that overwhelmingly support protecting these lands permanently - rather than radical anti-conservation politicians.\\n\\nAn attempt to attack one monument by rolling back protections would be an attack on them all. Sending a signal that protections for our shared history, culture, and natural treasures are not permanent would set a terrible precedent. This would discourage business investment and community growth around all national monuments while also sending the signal that our history and natural wonders are negotiable.\\n\\nNational monuments have already been shown to be tremendous drivers of the $887 billion outdoor recreation economy and businesses in gateway communities rely on the permanency of these protections when making decisions about investing in these communities. Whether at Grand Staircase-Escalante or Bears Ears National monuments or other monuments across the country, our national monuments should remain protected for future generations to enjoy - they are a gift that belongs to all Americans.\\n\\nI am firmly opposed to any effort to revoke or diminish protections for national monuments. I urge you to support our public lands and waters and recommend that our current national monuments remain protected.\\n\\nSincerely,\\nThe Undersigned')]),\n",
