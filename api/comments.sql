Control of this land does not lie with the states and the local population.\n3.\tThe Antiquities Act, under which the monuments were designated, does not give the president explicit power to undo a designation and no president has ever taken such a step.\n4.\tWeakening existing protections for these monuments will likely result in development and exploitation, ruining or de-valuing the values (natural and cultural) for which they were designated. \n5.\tThe monuments to be reviewed boast 1.9 million acres of canyons, arches, and pion-juniper forests.

I live less than 50 miles from the Bears Ears National Monument\n\nI support Rescinding Bears Ears National Monument.\n\nI feel that President Trump's Executive Order, a Review of Certain National Monuments Established Since 1996, is absolutely necessary for the Bears Ears National Monument designation, as well as many other immensely sized national monuments. The requirements and original objectives of the Antiquities Act was always meant to protect lands.\nLands designated over 100,000 acres, is truly a violation of the original intent of the Act, meant to not "exceed the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected."\n\nNative Americans, Local Residents and many people across our great nation have a clear majority in support of Rescinding Bears Ears National Monument as well as reducing the size of Grand Staircase-Escalante. These monuments are a federal over reach of the presidents power and against the framework of our great laws.\n\nI ask that President Trump listen to the people. \nPlease reverse the designation of the Bears Ears National Monument for its undemocratic and unjust process.\nI request that no more National Monument designations be established in the State of Utah	0	\N	\N	\N

In fact, we shuld continue\nsaving protecting and preserving additional lands for the environmental protection of all of America. those lands saved\nare utilized by people all over America. we are a united country and all of us protect all of the rest of us so that it is evil and ugly to \ntry to bring into this protection making states fight with each other. that is wrong and against the American spirit. one for\nall, all for one or we don't have a union. this call to start taking back what we saved for all of us, is an evil act. public comment\nwas taken at the times these lands were preserved and there is no reason to go back on what was protected and preserved.\nI am surprised that this evil act of trying to stop saving and protecting gods lands doesn't go back to l700.  I am very much\nopposed to this plan by president trump. that open space protects all of us by keeping in place nature, which is the only thing\nkeeping u s alive anymore. you all can see how industry, like in china, where they cant breathe the air healthfully, is what industry bring\nin. india is another country with huge developments tha bring with it bad air, bad soil and bad water.

IF WE LET PROFITEERS IN TO DESPOIL THESE LANDS, AS THIS INVESTIGATION SEEMT\nTO WANT TO BRING ABOUT, ALL OF US WILL DIE FROM THE UNHEALTHFULNESS OF THIS INDUSTRY. CLEAN \nNATURAL ENVIRONMENT IS NECESSARY TO OUR HEALTH. EVERY BIT OF LAND PROTECTED IS NECESSARY. TREES\nMAKE OXYGEN. CLEAN SOIL CAN PRODUCE CLEAN HEALTHFUL WATER. WHO WANTS TO DRINK LEAD WATER\nLIKE FLINT AND SO MANY OTHER SITES. THIS PROTECTION OF LAND IS NOT ABOUT JUST PAL "STAKEHOLDERS" OF TRUMP, IT IS\nABOUT THE SAFETY AND HEALTH OF ALL AMERICANS.

I have no problems with the use of the antiquities act used to designate these monuments. I believe these monuments are public goods in the truest sense of the term, and should be protected as such.

11	DOI-2017-0002-0011	2017-05-11	When you look at what other leading industrialized nations are doing (Korea, Japan, Finland, Singapore) they are looking for ways to immerse their populations in the outdoors to reduce stress and improve both mental and physical health.\n\nWe are blessed in the United States to have spaces which are still available for today and for tomorrow to offer access to a variety of ecosystems.  It is up to us to continue to provide protection for these places so that future generations can take advantage of the physical and mental benefits that wild places offer.\n\nThe Antiquities Act, created by a Republican Theodore Roosevelt, enables the preservation of these wild spaces.  \n\nDon't be the Republican who takes them away.	0	\N	\N	\N

13	DOI-2017-0002-0013	2017-05-11	I am a resident of Utah.  I want to comment on the two National Monuments in Utah currently under your review.  1.  Bears Ears.  I have travelled in the area in the past, but had never heard of all this area has to offer in outdoor recreation.  I will now follow the all this new information available and visit this area soon.  2.  Grand Staircase-Escalante was exactly the same to me before it became a National Monument.  I had never seen it before.  Once it became a National Monument, I followed all the new information that came out at that time.  I packed up the car, my mom, and my camera.  We spent 3 days exploring this new area...and it is very much worth keeping in the National Monument system.  Please remember that National Monuments often progress in time to be changed over to National Parks.  I have children, and there is nothing more I can leave to them then our National Parks and Monuments.  Utah has the big 5 National Parks now, and we should keep (and add) all this beautiful national land for the whole nation to visit (as well as a very busy international visitor list).  The Big 5 are overflowing with visitors.  Lets open more monuments and share those visitors around our beautiful state.  Thank you.	0	\N	\N	\N
14	DOI-2017-0002-0014	2017-05-11	Please do not rescind or reduce the size of any our our nation's national monuments.  Please do not allow natural resource extraction on any of our public lands.\n\nWe want more national monuments, more natural and cultural assets preserved for future generations - not less.\n\nI live in Utah and I know Bears Ears and Grand Escalante National Monuments are being specifically targeted for review.  Do not touch these national treasures.  Do not rescind or reduce these national monuments.  Do not allow natural resource extraction to destroy these national treasures.  Both monuments contain beautiful, fragile, unique geology and living ecosystems that need protection.  There exist thousands of historic Native American ruins and artifacts which need protection.\n\nSpecifically for Bears Ears, some San Juan County residents (who have no special claim to this FEDERAL land) who I have spoken to object because they fear loss of access, or loss of ranching, or loss fishing and hunting access.  None of this has changed with monument designation.\n\nThe local business owners of the San Juan County Chamber of Commerce supports the monument.\n\nWhile Federal land, belonging to all Americans, the Native American tribes do have reason for special consideration - the cultural and historical significance of the area is Native American.  The grave sites and ruins are Native American.  The land is sacred to these tribes.  Five tribes from the area have created the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition to officially support the monument designation and another 30 tribes have signed on to support.  There are a few individual tribe members who oppose, but they are in the distinct minority.  No tribe opposes.\n\nPlease, the national monuments are wonderful, don't take away their protection.  Don't let them be destroyed by short-sighted mining and energy companies.	0	\N	\N	\N

They are monuments to the people and places that make this country great, and thus are a physical expression of our national identity. Beyond that, They are long term economic drivers for the areas they are located in. Often existing leases are grandfathered in, and monuments are focal points for the growing tourism industry. \n\nMuch time and money has already been spent on the planning and maintenance of these places. This taxpayer doesn't want to see the money invested thrown away so that a few companies can make short term profits off of new leases. There are many leases up for bid on BLM lands now and considering the price of oil and the trajectory of the coal industry there is no need to exploit those contained in the Grand Staircase or other monuments.\n\nLand set aside under the Antiquities Act will remain intact preserving cultural and natural resources for generations in the future. The cost and maintenance of these sites is offset by the economic benefit provided by the outdoor community. Furthermore these lands are the crown jewels of our national prestige, and are the envy of many countries who don't have wildlands to enjoy. \n\nThank you for your consideration,\n\nBrian Flynn Professional Archaeologist	0	\N	\N	\N

22	DOI-2017-0002-0022	2017-05-11	I am so thrilled that Bears Ears was made a National Monument and thank that it, and the other previously established monuments should retain their designations. This land was federal land before they became monuments, and their new status allows them to be enjoyed by the public even more. I know that in the case of Bears Ears, the Federal Government was very careful to respect previous grazing leases and land use rights. Five tribes have been asking for this land to be protected as a monument. It's a level of cooperation amongst tribes that is seldom heard of. This land is sacred to them. They want it protected.\n\nAs a Colorado native and a passionate enthusiast of the National Parks and BLM land, I stand with the tribes and want to see Bears Ears protected as a monument. \n\nI work in the Outdoor Industry as a Manufacturers Rep and having healthy public land and parks accessible to the public only helps grow an industry I love so much and that drives a huge amount of money into local economies. In fact, I was in the four corners area recently specifically to visit Mesa Verde, Hovenweep, and Canyons of the Ancients and so whole-heartedly wish I had time to fit in Bears Ears. \n\nThe National Parks and Monuments are the greatest legacies Presidents can leave the nation they have served. Regardless of how I feel about a particular President, I will always respect the monuments they created. Bears Ears, Katahdin woods, Canyons of the Ancients, Grand Staircase Escalante. These are precious places and loved by so many. Do not revoke their designations. All 27 monuments should remain just that. I'm excited to visit them, learn more about them, hike in them, and spend money visiting them. Do not let the legacy of the current President be one of destruction and privatization rather than giving back to the American People. 	0	\N	\N	\N

I grew up on the Navajo Indian Reservation and I am very familiar with culture and traditions of my Navajo People. I raised seven children in San Juan County, Utah because it is a great place for raising families. I love open vastness of the area, the petroglyphs left by my ancestors and the freedom of choice it gives us. Because of that, I greatly oppose any additional regulations and United States Government control that would limit our freedom and restrict what my people can do. I feel the protection of the land is already in place. i don't believe a National Monument is the right answer. I use the land for hunting, fishing, hiking, tradition prayers, herb gathering for self healing, wood gathering, famiy reunions and just a place to escape the busy world. The two Native American tribes in San Juan, Utah, the Utes and Navajo all oppose the National Monument for similiar reason(s). \nI believe the best action to take in matter is to rescind the National Monument and give additional resources to existing federal agencies to perform the protection. I believe keeping it as a National Monument would be a big mistake. It would create restrictions to my people. Thank you for this opportunity to say my piece.

33	DOI-2017-0002-0033	2017-05-11	Hello,\n\nAs an avid outdoorsman, I find there is no greater joy in this world than time spent in the beauty of the outdoors. It is so fulfilling, on a personal and spiritual level, that I find myself constantly drawn to it. Not only do these national monuments provide a protected sanctuary for people like myself, their typical ease of access and widespread commercialization provide an opportunity for less experienced and, well, ordinary citizens to get out and find and experience this love and joy for themselves. I think this is critical for all people to experience, and once again I believe it is national monuments like Bears Ears and others that promote this. Further, I would think that our government would only want to continue promoting the outdoors and devoting resources to these monuments in the interest of public health. One way to keep healthcare costs down is to promote individual health, and you would be hard pressed to find a medical professional who doesn't think that hiking, biking, climbing, etc. are amazing for one's physical and mental health. Finally, shrinking national monuments and other public land is just so short sighted from an economic standpoint. Sure, you may be able to sell the land, but this is a one-time transaction with no future income for our government. And sure, some of the area may be used to mine and farm natural resources (timber), but again the government will see very little income as a result of this. The outdoor industry, on the other hand, generates around $640 billion of direct spending into the American economy, based on independent research studies. This, in turn, fuels other traditional industries, including apparel, manufacturing, finance, tourism, and travel, pumping even more money into our economy. I believe that research into the amount of corporate taxes generated from these industries more than covers any one-time income generated from the sale of this land. And this isn't even considering all of the jobs generated by these industries. If this administrations goal is job creation, this will do the exact opposite. So, as this plan to shrink these National Monuments does not make sense from an economic, healthcare, or personal perspective, I do not see how it makes any sense to move forward with it. I pray that you take your time and really look at all of the pros and cons of such a decision, and firmly believe you  will arrive at this same conclusion. Thanks for your time.   	0	\N	\N	\N

I am deeply disturbed that these unique and priceless areas of our country are potentially being opened up for oil and gas development. Not only will this irrevocably destroy beautiful and important natural areas in the United States, it will also send a message to the public that oil company profits and resource development are more important than allowing and and encouraging public land use.

416	DOI-2017-0002-0416	2017-05-12	The Honorable Ryan Zinke\nSecretary\nU.S. Department of the Interior\n1849 C Street, N.W.\nWashington, DC 20240\nDear Secretary Zinke:\nIn light of President Trump's recent Executive Order calling for a review of national monument designations, we are writing to provide you with important information about the public input process that led to the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument expansion, and how the proposal was modified in response to public feedback.\nWe are strong supporters of the monument, which has protected some of the most biodiverse public land in the United States since it was initially established in 2000. While we recognize that there will always be concerns about conservation management of monuments, we believe reasonable voices will agree that there was an extensive public input process that led to meaningful changes in response to concerns raised. We believe this is reflected by the diverse range of supporters of the expansion, including neighboring property owners, chambers of commerce, tribes, sportsmen, and others.\nThe Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument is important, in part because it was the first monument primarily dedicated to protecting biodiversity. After its modest expansion, it more fully encompasses an important ecological crossroads in an area of unique geology, biology, climate, and iconic American landscapes -where the volcanoes of the Cascade Range, the sage and juniper of the Basin and Range Province, and the world-renowned biodiversity of the Klamath-Siskiyou Mountains converge.\nThe proclamation followed an open and inclusive process that considered feedback from local communities and stakeholders. In April 2015, 85 scientists signed onto a report outlining the need to significantly expand the current monument boundaries to better protect the biological objects of interest the original monument was established to safeguard.\nAfter review of this proposed expansion and based on feedback from stakeholders and landowners potentially impacted, Oregon's Senators developed a significantly smaller map of the proposed 62,000-acre expansion. This proposal included areas proposed for conservation designations in legislative proposals for several years, as well as conservation designations that were already part of the BLM's Resource Management Plan for Western Oregon.\nSenator Merkley and former Deputy Secretary of the Interior Mike Connor held a hearing in Ashland, Oregon -- the closest city to the monument -- to solicit public comment on the proposed expansion of the monument. Approximately 500 citizens attended this meeting in Ashland, with 83 testifying in support and 36 in opposition. In addition to the public meeting hosted by Senator Merkley, there were three additional public hearings in Klamath Falls (hosted by Klamath County), in Medford (hosted by Jackson County), and in Yreka (hosted by Siskiyou County) that were attended by approximately 600 people. The testimony at these hearings was evenly divided between support for and opposition to the expansion.\nSenators Merkley and Wyden also established a written comment period to continue receiving public comment on the expansion proposal, for both those who did not, or could not attend a public meeting  to be able to submit more detailed written recommendations. \nIn addition to the feedback and support from the general public, the Cascade-Siskiyou Monument expansion enjoyed robust support from state and local elected officials, tribes, citizens, chambers of commerce, conservationists, and many local landowners. A partial list of the on-record support for the monument is attached.\nThe public input process led to substantive changes to the map to address concerns that had been raised. Ranchers that hold grazing leases in the Buck Mountain and Deadwood areas within the proposed expansion requested that their grazing allotments be excluded from the expansion boundaries. Senator Merkley's office conveyed these requests to the Obama Administration. The Buck Mountain allotment was largely excluded from the final boundaries and the Deadwood allotment, which is located in a sensitive watershed, had more of its territory excluded than in earlier proposals.\n\nBased on feedback from the public meeting and the comment period mentioned above, the final declaration included less than 48,000 acres, which is a reduction of over 14,000 acres from the discussion draft proposal put forward by Oregon's Senators.\nWe hope that you will consider the diverse public support and the public input process that led to expanding the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument as you review national monument designations. We also request that you consult with members of the Oregon Congressional delegation, the State of Oregon and federally recognized local tribes before making any decisions about the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument.\n \n \nSincerely,\nElisa Blue\nand Mother Earth	0	\N	\N	\N

These are public lands, as in they belong to myself and everyone in this country. They were set aside as a way to preserve areas of land that are sacred to some people and as a way to maintain them in their natural state. I do not support this administrations attempt to "undesignate" these monuments. \nFrom an economic standpoint - if you sell the lands and allow private companies to extract the natural resources - that's a one time land sale. Then any profits off that land is held by the companies who own it and that only lasts as long as the resources hold out. On the other hand, recreation is an evergreen industry - there will always be money spent in these areas as long as they are still monuments. The lifecycle financial analysis holds up that these areas should be maintained as revenue sources forever, not sold as a quick way to make a buck.\nPlease, I urge you not to make rash decisions based on making money. This country is not a business and short term gains are not in the country's best interest. Allow these monuments to maintain their status and preserve these areas for future generations to enjoy and spend their money.	0	\N	\N	\N

National Monuments have already received extensive comment and review from surrounding communities. This deliberation can take years and even decades, and no designation has succeeded without strong local grassroots support. \n- National Monuments provide tangible health, natural, and economic benefits. Protected outdoor spaces drive the outdoor recreation economy, supporting 7.6 million jobs while generating $887 billion in consumer spending each year. Protecting public lands from drilling, mining, and other exploitation sustainably improves local economies through tourism and outdoor recreation, while also preserving our nation's precious natural and cultural legacies.  \n- Our protected public lands help define who we are as a nation, and they bestow wealth on every American. Preservation of public lands is "America's greatest idea" (Wallace Stegner).\n- Protected lands are a tiny minority of all public lands. Of the 640 million acres of public land managed by the federal government, only about 12 million are protected as National Monuments. 	0	\N	\N	\N
47	DOI-2017-0002-0047	2017-05-11	National parks have been created in the United States for specific reasons such as the absolute need for balance in our environment and providing places in our country that can be enjoyed for lifetimes contributing to pleasure and education.  This balance has social effects as well as environmental effects.  \n\nThe social effects include the opportunity to experience nature resulting in a lifetime of protection of our environment.  As a child, I visited the Giant Sequoia.  Additionally, I spent most of my adult life living among the Giant Redwoods in Northern California.  The majestic experience of spending time among these ancient trees and enjoying the symbiotic elements of nature that is part of spending time in nature has been life changing.  Because of this time spent in National Parks I have spent the rest of my life supporting and protecting nature.  \n\nThe environmental affect is obvious. . . These National Parks (especially those with forests) are home to countless valuable creatures that help our planet to survive!  The balance of nature is critical to our planet's balance as is evidenced in the death of the coral reefs.  \n\nIt would seem to me that using our national parks as sites for oil and gas harvesting procedures would negatively affect the balance of nature as well as destroy the experience of citizens to have the lessons of nature.  It doesn't make any sense to me that this world is moving more and more toward sustainable energy (i.e. solar, thermal, and wind) and yet our government is proposing destroying our national jewels in the interest oil.  To destroy these very very valuable monuments in the interest of obtaining a source of energy that will continue to destroy our planet when there are alternatives will be felt for generations to come instead of creating positive social and environmental experiences seems counter productive.  \n\nRegarding the Giant Sequoia, how is it that the thirst for oil in this country (which is unsustainable) can be the reason to destroy trees that are thousands of years old and monuments that can never be replaced?  The idea of this destruction is VERY painful to me and so many people I know.\n\nPLEASE do not approve these National Parks' destruction.

49	DOI-2017-0002-0049	2017-05-11	Dear Secretary Zinke and the Department of the Interior,\nI am writing to voice my strong opposition for any attempt to the Hanford Reach National Monument Designation, and note my strong support for the continued preservation of this unique land in eastern Washington state. Growing up in Eastern Washington (Richland) near the National Monument, I spent many days floating the Columbia, fishing, and hiking in the lands protected by the monument. As an Eagle Scout, I have deep appreciation for preserving the outdoors while still allowing access for the community to enjoy the land, and the monument status has not impeded any recreational activities of mine, in fact, it has likely continued to preserve a protected space.\n\nWhile Bill Clinton was not the most popular President in eastern Washington, his decision to dedicate this land as a monument was supported by nearly all of my friends and family. I still remember the positive headlines in the Tri-City Herald, the local paper, when this happened, and I think the Department of the Interior would be doing a grave disservice to Eastern Washingtonians by any change in the Hanford Reach National Monument Designation. While I am now a medical student in North Carolina, I hope to return to Washington and be able to take my children to this special land. Please make this possible by not altering the monument designation. \n\n	0	\N	\N	\N

50	DOI-2017-0002-0050	2017-05-11	As someone who has lived in Utah for 40 years now, I have been actively involved in protecting America's public lands.  I have spent thousands of hours camping, hiking and exploring Southern Utah.   I know the land and the people of Utah well.\nWith that said I support both the GESNM and BENM.  The designations have insured the land and the current uses on them will continue for generations to come.  Additionally, they have contributed to the economic development of the communities surrounding the Monuments.  Numerous studies have shown that.\nLastly, the Antiquities Act enables a President to designate a Monument.  If the Trump administration or Utah's congressional delegation want to rescind any monuments I suggest they follow the law and go thru Congress to get that done.  The last thing we need is years of lawsuits and contentious debate that would follow if the President tries to rescind or alter the boundaries of our current Monuments.  \nThank you for hearing my support of our National Monuments here in Utah and across the country. \nJohn Trout	0	\N	\N	\N
51	DOI-2017-0002-0051	2017-05-11	Dear Secretary Zinke, \n\nOur national monuments and public lands and waters help define who we are as a nation by telling the story of our historical, cultural, and natural heritage.  I am extremely disappointed that President Trump has signed an executive order that attempts to undermine our national monuments.  Attempts to rollback protections for national monuments would be both illegal and terribly misguided and I strongly urge you to oppose any efforts to eliminate or shrink our national monuments.\n\nBears Ears National Monument in Utah, which is first on the list for this "review", is a textbook example of the priceless historic, cultural and natural wonders that are protected as National Monuments.  Protecting 100,000 archaeological and cultural sites as well as stunning mesas, canyons and arches and the incredible outdoor recreation, hunting, fishing and general solitude and peace they contain, these treasures are irreplaceable.  The designation and boundaries of the monument honors the voices of five sovereign tribal nations who joined together to seek protection of their shared ancestral lands and traditions, Bears Ears National Monument should remain protected permanently.\n\nAdditionally, an attempt to attack one monument by rolling back protections would be an attack on them all.  Sending a signal that protections for our shared history and culture are not permanent would set a terrible precedent.  This would discourage business investment and community growth around all national monuments while also sending the signal that our history and natural wonders are negotiable.  National monuments have already been shown to be tremendous drivers of the $887 billion outdoor recreation economy and businesses in gateway communities rely on the permanency of these protections when making decisions about investing in these communities.  Whether at Bears Ears or other monuments across the country, our national monuments should remain protected for future generations to enjoy - they are a gift that belongs to all Americans. \n\nI am firmly opposed to any effort to revoke or diminish protections for National Monuments and I urge you to support our public lands and waters and recommend that our current national monuments remain protected.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJordan Schreiber	0	\N	\N	\N
52	DOI-2017-0002-0052	2017-05-11	I seek to voice my opinion that Bears Ears National Monument should be minimized in its land usage. I believe the original protections by the BLM were effective and promoted multi purpose use in an equal opportunity fashion.  Having dealt with the Moab BLM office a few times, I found them to be very professional and easily accessible for permitting situations.  It is my opinion that National Monument status would create a tourist economy for the locals of Blanding, and having lived in tourist economies, I am aware of the hardships for housing and seasonal employment it creates. Therefore, I believe the Monument should be minimized to include only the actual Bears Ears, and not the 1.3 million acres that was excessively declared, as the majority of that land was already protected as multi use.\n\nThank You	0	\N	\N	\N

54	DOI-2017-0002-0054	2017-05-11	I live in Las Cruces, NM and near a newly established monument, the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument.  The status of which is now under threat by the new administration in Washington.  People in our area have been fed misinformation about what enacting the protections to the land come along with a National Monument designation. We are in a somewhat unique situation. Las Cruces being in close proximity to the Mexican border, opponents to the designation believe that access for law enforcement, specifically Border Patrol, are now hindered in doing their jobs due to limits of motor vehicle access provisions. They claim that law enforcement aren't able to patrol these areas for illegal immigrants and smugglers.  This is simply not true.  Ranchers are also saying their access will be limited for grazing.  I also know this not to be true.  I feel the true purpose for removing these designated National Monument areas are simply to allow a minority of wealthy people to privatize our PUBLIC lands, develop them and begin drilling and mining them - and ultimately destroying the land for future generations.  It disgusts me that my own Congressman for my district, Steve Pearce,who seeks to unravel these designations in order for him and his friends to profit. People like Steve Pearce are the real threat to America. He leaches of the system that being a career politician affords him, yet has never truly represented his own constituents in Las Cruces. In Las Cruces, nothing draws visitors to our town more than the beauty of our Organ Mountains, which are pristine at present, but are now threatened by taking away its protected status. The Monument affords hiking, camping, hunting and so much more. To take away the designation, in essence, ripping away the funds necessary to maintain this natural wonder, cannot stand.  I implore you to keep the designation as-is, so that present and future generations may continue to enjoy the wonders of this beautiful, natural area without oil derricks, overgrazing and pit mining which would ruin this land forever.	0	\N	\N	\N

68	DOI-2017-0002-0068	2017-05-11	I am a life-long westerner. The western US is defined by wide-open space, grand vistas, unique vegetation communities, unique and quite large geological features, and extensive remains of prehistoric civilizations. I have benefited from access to public lands my whole life and been enriched. Recent National Monuments created under the Antiquities Act have only enhanced this. These are not "federal land grabs", previously federal land is staying in federal hands. These do not restrict use or access...I visit these monuments often, usually for free! Most land uses are still permitted, including some extractive ones as long as they don't disrupt the object of conservation. They are NOT too big. Antiquities and other objects of conservation are BIG, thus the monuments are appropriately sized. For example, Comb Wash is 100 miles long and riddled with ancient ruins! These monuments are not damaging to economies (only to certain sectors, and then only maybe). For example, Bear's Ears will be an economic boon to Bluff, Monticello, and Moab, and Native American communities from an expanded tourism industry. Finally, when multiple Native peoples unite in support of a monument, its only fair that we listen to them. They were here first, and their united voice should matter much more than it does.

It's full of recreational opportunities, from hiking, camping and mountain biking to horseback riding, hunting, spelunking and sightseeing. It should not be shrunk or changed.\n\nThe proclamation of Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument came after a campaign for the area's designation, supported by a coalition of counties and cities in the region (many of which passed resolutions of support), the California State Legislature, the Elem Indian Colony of Pomo Indians, state and local political leaders, local newspaper editorial boards, conservationist and environmental organizations, recreation groups, local business owners and landowners. It should not be shrunk or changed.\n\nCanyons of the Ancients National Monument is a national monument protecting an archaeologically-significant landscape. The monument was proclaimed in order to preserve the largest concentration of archaeological sites in the United States, primarily Ancestral Puebloan ruins. Over 6,000 individual archeological sites had been identified within the monument. The nation's push for energy resources on federal land is occurring at a cost of archaeological and cultural resources. 85% of the monument was under lease by ranchers and oil and gas exploration entities in the year 2000. We are at risk of jeopardizing the archaeological sites, and no further oil and gas exploration should be allowed here. The monument should not be shrunk or changed. If anything, protections should be expanded.\n\nThe Carrizo Plain National Monument is the largest single native grassland remaining in California. If it's shrunk, or changed, and we lose that native grassland, it's gone forever. The monument should not be shrunk or changed. If anything, protections should be expanded.\n\nThe Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument is the first monument set aside solely for the preservation of biodiversity, and that's an incredible, uniquely American idea. It has one of the most diverse ecosystems found in the Cascade Range. The monument was rightly expanded by Obama and should not be shrunk or changed. If anything, protections should be expanded.\n\nCraters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve protects volcanic features and represent one of the best-preserved flood basalt areas in the continental United States. The monument and preserve should not be shrunk or changed.\n\nGiant Sequoia National Monument is includes 38 of the 39 Giant Sequoia groves located in Sequoia National Forest, about half of the sequoia groves currently in existence. If we lose or damage these trees, they're gone, and we can't get them back. The monument and preserve should not be shrunk or changed. If anything, protections should be expanded.\n\nGold Butte National Monument protects nearly 300,000 acres of desert landscapes featuring a wide array of natural and cultural resources, including rock art, sandstone towers, and important wildlife habitat for species including the Mojave Desert tortoise (a threatened species), bighorn sheep, and mountain lion. Prior to the area's designation as a national monument, Gold Butte suffered "an increasing level of damage near historic and cultural sites"; an August 2016 report by Friends of Gold Butte reported "dismantled historic corrals and fences, felled Joshua trees and petroglyphs peppered with bullet holes." The monument should not be shrunk or changed. If anything, protections should be expanded.\n\nIronwood Forest National Monument is home to a significant concentration of ironwood trees, along with two federally recognized endangered animal and plant species. More than 200 Hohokam and Paleo-Indian archaeological sites have been identified in the monument, dated between 600 and 1450. The monument should not be shrunk or changed. If anything, protections should be expanded. New mining claims and motorized off-road travel should continue to be prohibited.\n\nMojave Trails National Monument protects the remote and nearly pristine Cadiz Dunes that formed from the sand of dry lake beds. If they're damaged, we don't get the dunes back. The monument should not be shrunk or changed.\n\nVermilion Cliffs National Monument protects some of the most unique and interesting rock features in the country, and was created from lands already under the management of the U.S. Government. The monument should not be shrunk or changed.\n\nKatahdin Woods and Waters National Monument is opposed by a minority of people, and the land was donated for that purpose.

No doubt lands from any dissolved or diminished monuments get sold to the highest bidder - probably energy companies - and quickly environmentally devastated. These monuments weren't arbitrarily created. They have cultural and natural significance to the American people. If this administration wants to swell the military budget, and gut health care to afford tax cuts for the rich, it's not a matter of whether we have the resources to properly manage these lands - it's a question of whether we have the brains and the integrity to properly prioritize the allocation of federal resources.

98	DOI-2017-0002-0098	2017-05-11	On a recent bucket-list trip, I had the privilege of visiting Bears Ears National Monument.  Before I entered the monument, I was asked by a native-American to "please be respectful."  I was and I promised him that I would do everything I could to help protect this special place.  Please know that I fully support the current protections for our public lands and I oppose any actions that would diminish those protections.  I want my grandchildren to have the privilege of visiting these unique and sacred areas of our great country and to find them protected and cherished.\nGrowing up fishing, hunting and camping in Virginia and North Carolina, I grew to understand the value of the limited public lands available.  I have had discussions with people from Monticello and Blanding Utah who are opposed to the National Monument designation and to the designated boundaries of the monument. I fear that those who grow up with an abundance of readily available public lands cannot understand its full value.  Worse, anything of apparent abundance seems to lie open to not just uses, but abuses. \nAs for why I believe Bears Ears requires National Monument status, I will remind you of some of the objectives presented by the Inter-Tribal Coalition in their proposal for establishment of the Monument: \n\n-\t Expanded law enforcement capacity to safeguard tribal antiquities, finally putting an end to the inexcusable, centuries-long grave-robbing, looting, and destruction of some of the most precious archaeological sites in the world;  \n \n-\tA permanent withdrawal from mining covering all lands within the monument, and withdrawal from all other forms of leasing, selections, sales, exchange, and disposition, other than those exchanges that further the purposes of the monument; \n \n-\tRestriction of motorized vehicle use to existing and designated roads and trails, consistent with the purposes of the monument and with a transportation plan that prioritizes pristine and roadless areas within the monument; \n \n-\tThe continuation of existing, compatible local uses such as climbing, firewood gathering, grazing, hunting according to state and tribal law, and the Native American collection of medicines, herbs, and ceremonial plants;  \n\nIt certainly seems to me the Coalition's objectives are reasonable, respectful of existing leases and rights, and are furthered by both National Monument designation and the adoption of a joint Federal-Tribal management system.  I think some of the concerns leading to National Monument designation are evident. The Coalition noted that more than a dozen serious looting cases were reported in the year between May 2014 and April 2015.  Additional law enforcement, with appropriate Federal and Tribal oversight, will help reduce that problem. Additionally, regulation of 4-wheeler use of the area will make such desecration more difficult. \nTo those who object to the size of the Bears Ears designation.  I will remind you that it is nearly 600,000 acres smaller than that proposed by the Coalition. In their proposal, the Coalition noted "While we wish we could protect more of this ancestral landscape, what we are left with - and now propose - is what we believe is the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects we believe should be protected by monument designation."   I believe the compromise boundary that was established under the designation is appropriate.  \nI emphasize that I would be strongly opposed to the uncompensated taking of any existing leases, mining or grazing. I agree that the lands should be open for use under State of Utah and Ute hunting and fishing laws. I agree that firewood gathering should continue under appropriate management. Generally, I agree that the land must remain open to wide public use, while protecting it from abuse.  Again, I see significant utility of National Monument designation in accomplishing those goals. \nThe Linville Gorge Wilderness Area is nearly right outside my backdoor. Yes, it is sometimes a pain that I must get a permit to do backcountry camping in it and yes, since I use firewood, it would be convenient to abuse that public land by collecting my firewood from it.  But, please know, that I will do my best to protect the area and to ensure that you, your children and grandchildren may someday have the opportunity to enjoy this unspoiled place.  \nI hope that I can count on you to follow the language and intent of the Antiquities Act of 1906 and protect the designation and boundary of Bears Ears National Monument. \n	0	\N	\N	\N

99	DOI-2017-0002-0099	2017-05-11	Two years ago I was fortunate enough to take a 4 day backpacking trip in Grand Staircase / Escalate National Monument. We hiked to a spectacular double arch that seemed to transport our small group back in time. The remarkable rock formations and abundant flora and fauna remained prominate characters in the Wild West adventure that was our four day trip. A sight that I can still see in my mind was from the modest parking area at the trailhead. As far as we could see, in all directions, was rolling scrub land the seamlessly morphed into the sky. It really set the scene for an epic journey for this Pacific Northwest adventurer.\n\nMy worry is that the Trump administration will shrink the size of Escalate (and other monuments like Bears Ears) and open the door to oil rigs and other energy equipment that are out of place in areas like this. \n\nI am so thankful to the courageous politicians and conservationists of the past who saw the importance of places like Zion, Olympic and so many other dramatic federal lands that are now so important to people all over the world. \n\nTo me it makes since that as our population grows, our protected public lands should grow. \n\nPLEASE leave ALL Monuments as they are for the sake of future visitors who want to escape to these truly unique and humbling areas. \n 	0	\N	\N	\N
100	DOI-2017-0002-0100	2017-05-11	I wish to offer my request that Bears Ears National Monument (and Grand Staircase Nat'l Monument) be left as is and not altered in any way.  I am a 46 year resident of Utah and have experienced the beauty and the healing impact of these lands.  When you visit these areas you are given the opportunity to experience nature, history and native cultures and an unforgettable awe that is difficult to explain if you have not experienced it.  Luckily I have and will never forget those experiences. \n\nThe majority of local residents near Grand Staircase are pro-monument as they have seen increased economic benefits from the designation.  Statewide polls show that a majority of state residents support these monuments.  The former Interior Secretary, Sally Yates, conducted a 3 hour public hearing about Bears Ears and spoke to many residents of Utah before recommending the designation.  I personally wrote to President Obama voicing my support of the designation as did many, many others in the state.  There are a small number of residents who oppose these monuments in comparison with those who support them.  It is also time to allow our native peoples the respect they deserve and hear their pleas for preservation of Bears Ears as it now exists.\n\nThere has been much misinformation bandied around by those opposed to these monuments.  I would request that an impartial review of all views on these monuments be considered.  You might start by reviewing public comments in the Opinion section of the Salt Lake Tribune sent over several weeks/months by so many of Utah residents who know and love these lands and want them preserved for all time.  It is time to listen to all the people of Utah and not just the anti-government residents.\n\nThe economic benefits that Utah sees from its national parks and monuments are undeniable.  They benefit the many not just the few.  Please preserve the beautiful land and irreplaceable antiquities of these monuments.  Bears Ears is sacred to the native peoples and to many of the rest of us.\n\nThank you for your consideration of my heartfelt plea.   \n\n\n\n\n\n   	0	\N	\N	\N
101	DOI-2017-0002-0101	2017-05-11	I am writing to urge you to continue full protection for all U.S. National Monuments, including the spectacular Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument. Our U.S. National Parks, National Monuments, and other protected public lands are a critical part of what makes America great already!\n\nThe Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument is gem among Oregon public lands.\n\nThe Monument is at the rare intersection of three mountain ranges, the Cascades, the Siskiyou, and the Klamath Mountains. The unique mix of plants and animals in the Monument makes it an unparalleled treasure of diversity.\n\nThe Monument is a perfect example of public lands supporting multiple uses.\n\nThe Monument supports a wide range of recreation, like hunting, fishing, driving, biking, bird and butterfly watching, mushroom hunting, and hiking, including along the Pacific Crest Trail. It also supports clean water, scientific research, educational programs, and is the beautiful mountain backdrop to Ashland and Talent, OR. Together, these uses are critical to Southern Oregon's growing tourism economy and all the jobs and taxes that result. \n\nThe Monument is widely supported throughout the local area.\n\nDuring its original designation and again when the Monument was expanded, it received overwhelming local support, including dozens of landowners with inholdings and bordering the Monument, local city councils, state and Tribal officials, the Governor, Representatives, and Senators. The list of thousands of supporters from surrounding communities and others across the U.S. is constantly growing.\n\nThe push to open the Monument is coming from outsiders.\n\nThe sole witness invited to the Republican-led congressional hearing on President Trump's plan to gut Monument protection was an out-of-state timber executive from a timber company headquartered outside the region. A special interest group of logging lobbyists from hundreds of miles away is leading the fight to kill the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument.\n\nIt's clear that rolling back Monument protection is only the first step in the extreme anti-public lands agenda of selling off America's treasures to corporations. We need to keep public lands in public hands. The first step is to leave all U.S. Monuments protected.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to comment,\n	0	\N	\N	\N

My great great grand father is Walter C. Lyman he was one the founders of Blanding. My roots are deep here. I am against the monument. The land was already under federal protection and I believe that the designation of the Bears Ears National Monument will ruin the land and archeological sites that it is supposed to be protecting. By making it a National Monument and publicizing it, it will bring th\nousands of people here. Just since the designation in December 2016 I have already seen an influx of people. While I do not think their intention is to destroy that is what is happening there is trash and human waste dotting the land that once was not there.  My brother hunts on the bears is and has seen even more destruction that goes beyond just trash. I welcome anyone who wants to come see this beautiful and sacred  land but I think that there is a way to control and protect besides a monument.  There has been rumor that the locals are destroying the land. I am fully aware there has been looting and desecration of ancient sites and maybe even some by local people but overall the people that live here love this land and want to take care of it more than anyone else. I love seeing this land by hiking, and UTV riding and my fear is that because of the sheer amount of land that falls in the Bears Ears and not enough man power and funding to control it that it will slowly be shut down to any use at all.

111	DOI-2017-0002-0111	2017-05-11	Dear Secretary Zinke,\nI am a forester who was born and raised in the West. I grew up in Wyoming, went to college in Oregon, have worked in Oregon, California, Washington and Idaho as a forester. I currently reside in Idaho and am concerned for the fate of many of the public monuments. I understand the difficulties first hand of land management, particularly in the public sector due to uncertain funding, political pendulums and a public with vastly different priorities. \n\nI want you and your staff to know where my family and I stand. I have been to several of the monuments on the list including Bears Ears, Cascade Siskiyou, Craters of the Moon, Giant Sequoia, Grand Staircase and the Mojave Trails. I have dreamed of seeing some of the others on your list and want them protected for my children's children to appreciate. I am a mother of two children. \n\nWhile we don't graze cattle or develop fossil fuels, we do make our money from timber. However, we also enjoy camping, hiking, picnicking, fishing, exploring our nation's history, and wondering at the marvels of this planet in less-developed places. Going to a place that is grazed, full of weeds and cow feces, a recently harvested forest stand, or an oil rig is a different experience than looking up at a giant sequoia, seeing ancient artifacts or viewing natural desert wildflowers. I think there is a place for federally managed grazing, timber harvest and energy development on public lands.  However, judging from the places I have personally visited on your list, I feel much more comfortable with the government holding the list of monuments in the most protected way possible. While my salary is derived directly from natural resources, I have first-handedly seen what private economic interests can do to a place. I have much more faith in the ability of our well-trained public agency staff to best manage land responsibly in a way that benefits the most citizens and the natural resource.\nThe monument status seems entirely appropriate for the places to be reviewed. The areas on your list were set aside due to cultural, botanical, geologic and other reasons. Federal protections and management best serve the general public for the amazing places on your list for review. The monument status allows the majority of Americans to benefit from these great places, rather than a select few with private business interests. Our population is only growing, and the land base is not. In the west we take it for granted but most people do not have the privilege of owning land. These places inspire and bring wonder to our younger generations who have fewer contacts with the land as we tend to urbanize. In my view, the reason our country is so amazing is the vast amount of public land. I have traveled around the world, and we have an amazing resource out west unavailable to most countries! The monument status does not preclude all management, but it does work to protect the cultural, ecological and geologic values of a place. \n\nI would also like to point out that the monuments listed by previous presidents were not set aside randomly, the process was thorough and thought out. Most of us supported these designations, though I recognize there are always a few who do not. Many of us who supported such designations were quietly happy. I hope we speak up at this time but it is time consuming and difficult to contribute to the public process when you have children, work full-time and otherwise live busy lives. I'm still not sure why we are having to revisit the designation and find it frustrating. The attack on public lands in the last few months has been time consuming for those of us who care and believe public land can, and should benefit the public rather than a select few. I request that in the future we do not have to revisit any more previously designated monuments. It is counter-productive.\n\nThank you for your time. \n	0	\N	\N	\N
112	DOI-2017-0002-0112	2017-05-11	I am a U.S. citizen and a resident of California. Six of the monuments under review are in my state. I strongly urge Secretary Zinke to keep all of the monument designations under review in tact. The Antiquities Act of 1906 was instituted to protect valuable lands and cultural heritage sites from looting and excavation. Without these protections in place, the monuments on this list will open up to private interests and corporations for the purposes of drilling, fracking, and/or development. Not only do these activities destroy the natural environment and habitats protected therein, they destroy the cultural heritage of the people who lived and still live on these lands. As an American, I have had the great privilege to visit and use these monuments. They have humbled me, inspired me, and given me an appreciation for this country that is incalculable. I urge the Secretary not to take that away from me and every other American.\n	0	\N	\N	\N

They should be left untouched by greedy businesses who believe our undeveloped countryside is there for the raping and taking.  This is especially important in Utah where 2 our of 3 Utahns support their protected status. This support is also shared by citizens across the West who recognize the importance of wild spaces.  Making a decision concerning these spaces without equal time give to tribal concerns is autocratic and unacceptable. \n	0	\N	\N	\N

I am a local resident and the Bears Ears National Monument is not far from our city limits. \n\nI am solidly in favor of rescinding the Bears Ears Nation Monument.\n\nI am so appreciative of President Trump for signing the executive order to review the Antiquities Act and the Monuments. This presidential power has been abused and is largely the result of Special Interest groups and big money environmental organizations. We have suffered intimidation and abuse by these groups in this community. We are small in population but we love this land and care for it. We know the effects the monument will have on our infrastructure, our tax base and SITLA sections that give hope for the future of our school children and jobs in the community. This land is already BLM land, Forest Service land, and National Recreation Area. There are large amounts of Wilderness Study Areas and Primitive areas set aside within these Federally owned public lands. The protection is there for these lands! A monument restricts the land further and brings in large amounts of people that can be hard on the land and intrude on sacred areas for our Native American residents. The Antiquities Act must be revised to protect against further abuse.\n\nWe are smaller in number here and politically speaking it is easy for this land we call home to become politicized and be used as a pawn in many circumstances. We so very much appreciate the visit from Secretary of the Interior Ryan ZInke. He listened and counseled with our local elected officials, that we the citizens, chose to represent us, the local citizens. He was even so gracious as to get out of his car and speak with and mingle with the people who were able to come to welcome him and thank him for coming to the county.

That will long be remembered here in San Juan County. \n\nPresident Trump is unique in that he is putting "principles above politics" and is listening to the voice of the people and has an interest in rural America.

116	DOI-2017-0002-0116	2017-05-11	To Whom it May Concern - I am writing in support of the established national monuments in Utah, in particular Bears Ears and Grand Staircase national monuments which are being considered to rescind their size or remove their designation in totality.\n\nFirst off, I am a resident of Utah who is very proud of the land and the beauty it offers ALL Americans and international visitors. I recently took my elderly parents on a trip to Grand Staircase. We supported the towns of Escalante and Boulder by eating in their establishments and staying in their hotels.  Restaurants were crowded and we had to go off season as there were no room available during 'tourist' time.  I hear from Utah residents how the monuments are destroying their town, their livelihood, etc., but from what I could see, it was contributing to their livelihood. New homes were being built, new establishments, etc.  It is also not true that having a monument will "NOT" allow grazing/ranching/fishing/recreating, etc.  I first visited Escalante in the 1990's, way before it became a monument and all those things (grazing/ranching/fishing/recreating) are still going on.  Destroying the land to allow short term industries, like coal mining, gas drilling, only assists the towns temporarily.  Those industries are not the future, but like the pony express, blacksmithing, etc. are of the past.  Other things to consider are the amount of archaeological information/history that is in Grand Staircase.  The Utah Museum of Natural History have found so many dinosaur bones on the Kaiparowtts plateau!  Even the Mormon Pioneers have history there. Old Ranchers, paths nitched into the rock.  There is so much history that can be found. \n\nSecondly, mainly in regards to Bears Ears national monument, how often do we have 5 indigenous tribes working together to protect a land they hold sacred?  Unfortunately, rarely. So the fact that all these individuals and groups think this area is worth preserving deserve to have it protected. I recently heard a talk with a San Juan county resident who emphasized that the monument would take away their right to graze their cattle and ranch the land. Again, that's not true. Grazing doesn't go away.  The county residents shouldn't be 'ranching' on federal land. If they own a ranch, then that is their land and it wont affect it.  Allowing the land to be privately owned has backfired as the school trust land recently auctioned off land that is now off limits to EVERYONE.  Unfortunately, on one of my first trips to Blanding I went to see the kiva just outside of town. It had been vandalized, graffitied, and nearly destroyed.  We, as citizens of this country, need to preserve our past, respect other cultures and be thankful for what we have.\n\nThird, a lot has been commented on how much public outreach or coordination with 'relevant stakeholders' has taken place.  For years the areas of Grand Staircase were included in legislation to make parts of it wilderness (a much more stringent conservation label that would not have allowed grazing) and Bears Ears has been under consideration for over 7 years.  Congressman Bishop tried to create a plan that many stakeholders didnt feel was adequate enough. Our last president felt it appropriate to honor the wishes of the majority of the tribes who want this protected. I know a big emphasis is on the San Juan county residents, but unfortunately, the tribe makes up the majority of those residents and it's been proven time and time that their voices are 'silenced'.  \n\nI hope you consider my request to keep the monuments as they are. I don't think people 20 years from now will be disappointed.	0	\N	\N	\N
117	DOI-2017-0002-0117	2017-05-11	I support retaining these as protected lands. We need more land that is natural and unaltered by humanity in order for our one and only ecosystem to thrive. 	0	\N	\N	\N
118	DOI-2017-0002-0118	2017-05-11	In the U.S. by the time a National Monument has been established, public input and governmental and private review has occurred for many years. Meanwhile, the oil and gas exploration and production that consumes millions of acres throughout our nation is under far less review, with little public input. Specifically, the Bears Ears National Monument in SE Utah is an incredible area and it was established with the intention of ensuring tribal expertise and knowledge is preserved with its preservation. The tribal people of this country are owed much more than this, but this is a start. In the state of Utah, we are experiencing record numbers of tourism with billions of dollars spent as people come to visit the National Parks or recreate throughout our beautiful landscape. And yet, our elected officials in Utah ignore the wishes of their constituents and fail to "connect the dots" in terms of what landscape protection, monuments,  and tourism mean for our economy and instead focus on providing favors and decreasing regulations for the oil and gas industry. We must create more National Monuments, keep the ones we have designated, and focus on protecting and healing the open land that remains.	0	\N	\N	\N
119	DOI-2017-0002-0119	2017-05-11	I urge you to protect both Katahdin Woods and Waters and Bears Ears National Monuments.\n\nThe facade given to this review is that the National Monuments of the last 3 decades are unusually large and have taken place without public input.\n\nKatahdin Woods and Waters is under 100,000 acres. This is smaller than many other National Monuments.  It's also smaller than the amount given as a reason for this review. The land was privately owned and given to the Federal Government, along with a generous amount of money to aid with the establishment of the National Monument and its upkeep. Much of the great Eastern forests have been lost, it is necessary to save the small amounts that remain - so that future generations can be moved by this land in the way that the Eastern forests gave inspiration to H. D. Thoreau and the great President Theodore Roosevelt. \n\nBears Ears is much much larger, but its size alone is not a reason to challenge Bears Ears as a National Monument. Some people have wanted to protect Bears Ears since the 1930's. There are hundreds of thousands of archaeological sites in Bears Ears and its created was supported by over 30 Native American tribes. It has unique Cultural, Historical and Environmental purposes. When you evaluate this monument, you need to consider not only the voices of the elite and powerful. You must also consider the voices of the Native peoples who have traditionally been powerless in their dealings with the Federal Government but whom have come together in an unprecedented way to ask for this protection because it honors their cultural and their history. They will still be able to collect plants and medicinal herbs and wood.\n\nInterestingly, Bears Ears is already listed on the Utah Tourism website. It is featured along with the Mighty 5 National Parks. Parks that have drawn countless visitors to Utah. Arches National Park began as a National Monument. Bryce Canyon NP began as a National Monument. Zion National Park began as a National Monument. Capital Reef National Park also began as a National Monument. Utah has turned these places into a reason to visit their state, even though some people fought the creation of every one. \n\nSecretary Zinke, himself acknowledge the economic boon that National Parks provide to the economy.  In 2016, the number is $34.9 Billion.  My desire to show the greatness of this country to my family has led me to the Everglades, Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon, among other National Parks, Monuments, Battlefields and Historic Sites- far from my home in Illinois and leads countless others much farther from home. We must recognize the greatness of these places, they enrich us, they allow us to find ourselves and to see things that would otherwise cease to exist.  Even if I never set foot in Bear's Ears or Katahdin Woods and Waters, I am richer because they exist, my children are richer because they exist. That is why we have National Parks and Monuments, because we benefit from their existence. Once they are left unprotected, we can never regain what is lost. \n\nThis controversy reminds me of why Grand Canyon N.P started as a National Monument - because a few wanted to profit at the expense of everyone else.  When Pres. Roosevelt first saw the the Grand Canyon, he was so moved that he said "In the Grand Canyon, Arizona has a natural wonder which is in kind absolutely unparalleled throughout the rest of the world. I want to ask you to keep this great wonder of nature as it now is. I hope you will not have a building of any kind, not a summer cottage, a hotel or anything else, to mar the wonderful grandeur, the sublimity, the great loneliness and beauty of the canyon. Leave it as it is. You cannot improve on it. The ages have been at work on it, and man can only mar it."\n\nThis is what I believe to be true of Katahdin and Bears Ears, man can only mar them. There is nothing we can do that will improve or heighten what they give to us. There is no economic purpose that outweighs their cultural, historic and environmental gifts. Please save these places. If they are lost, we all lose a piece of ourselves. \n	0	\N	\N	\N

120	DOI-2017-0002-0120	2017-05-11	I support the current national monument designations in their entirety; including the Grand Staircase Escalante and Bears Ears National Monument designations and all of the monuments identified in the recent executive order of April 26, 2017.  I think there was adequate public involvement in the creation of these monuments.  Protecting the lands and resources within these monuments makes our nation stronger.  I believe that there are adequate energy and other resources available elsewhere without having to exploit the resources within the boundaries of the national monuments.  In addition, the resources in the national monuments are not going anywhere and if a future national emergency required their exploitation they would be available.  If they are all consumed now then our nation will be that much weaker in the future.\n\nTherefore, I urge Secretary Zinke to recommend to the President to keep all of the current national monument designations in place.	0	\N	\N	\N
121	DOI-2017-0002-0121	2017-05-11	Bears Ears is an appropriate monument. Leave it. \n\nI read in the DOI press release of May 5 that Sec Zinke and the president feel, although a public comment period is not required for monument designations under the Antiquities Act, local input is a critical component of federal land management. Well, by golly, I bet both will be glad to hear a LOT of attention was paid by President Obama to the concerns of San Juan County, Utah residents as he considered the establishment of Bears Ears Monument. \n\nEfforts to preserve this wonderfully rich cultural and natural area stretch back to 1930s. In 2010 the Obama administration included Cedar Mesa, the heart of the Bears Ears monument on a list of sites for possible protection under the Antiquities Act.\nThe Native Americans were interested in preserving the ancestral homeland of numerous tribes. In 2015 an intertribal coalition formally asked Obama to designate a 1.9 million acre monument. This proposal was debated publicly and openly including exchanges with Utah officials. In July 2016, Interior Secretary Jewell and other federal land management officials traveled to the town of Bluff, Utah to hold a public hearing which was attended by approximately 1,000 people. \n\nAccommodations were made for Native American concerns about gathering herbs and pion nuts. The Daneros uranium mine that was within the proposed boundaries as well as some areas where oil drilling historically took place were left out of the final boundaries even though they are rich with paleontological resources. Existing grazing rights were protected and new ones will be allowed. \n\nThe land that makes up the Bears Ears monument was all land managed by federal land agencies. No private, state or other land was "grabbed". Instead this appropriate use of the Antiquities Act of 1906 preserved an area that is rich with ancient artifacts, animals, plants and natural beauty. The economy of the area will be boosted as tourists flock to the monument like they do the other national parks and monuments located in the beautiful state of Utah. Already the San Juan School District's website touts the plethora of public lands and national parks and monuments lying within its borders.	0	\N	\N	\N

This was typical of the last 8 years that the only interest was his own, and not the American people.  You should remove these as protected areas and show it for what it is a fake way to delay business and government business against the people they were supposed to protect.  This wasn't about protecting land, it was about stopping the American dreams near or around those areas.  Thank you for your leadership and painting the picture of the games played by those that truly hate America and those of the last 8 years that worked for globalism not for our country.  Thank you Mr. Trump!  Remove any lands that prevent your agenda, and those that put you in office, from moving forward.

The requirements and original objectives of the Antiquities Act was always meant to protect lands.\nLands designated over 100,000 acres, is truly a violation of the original intent of the Act, meant to not "exceed the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected."\nNative Americans, Local Residents and many people across our great nation have a clear majority in support of Rescinding Bears Ears National Monument.\nI ask that President Trump listen to the people.

133	DOI-2017-0002-0133	2017-05-11	As someone who has lived on the Arizona Strip for 5 years and have visited the most controversial of these monuments, Grand Staircase-Escalante, and Bears Ears many times, I am appalled at the amount of misinformation being handed to the American public about these lands. Bears Ears is a COMPROMISE that benefits all parties. Access will not be limited, traditional practices and wood gathering is still allowed. Important mineral (specifically uranium) resources were intentionally left outside of the boundaries, which followed almost exactly the same lines as the Utah Public Lands Initiative proposal. Rescinding the monument status will only turn the lands back to where they started: Still in the hands of Federal Land Managers. The only difference will be the quality of the protections, and the absence of a Native voice in their future, which has proven to be detrimental to these lands that are EVERY Americans' birthright. \nOver two decades, Grand Staircase-Escalante has forever changed the communities around it for the better. Even in the last five years I have seen the towns of Escalante, Boulder, Tropic, and Kanab flourish and grow. New businesses are popping up every year, and business owners I have met have expressed difficulty in finding and housing new workers. The growth of these gateway communities has brought in numerous jobs in the service industry, adventure guiding, as well as planning and construction. It seems every visit to Kanab a new building has popped up or a new restaurant has opened. \nIf the elected officials in the state of Utah are so opposed to these monuments, why does the state tourism office bother to advertise for them? Because without the massive tourism economy in their state they would be truly sunk. These lands are managed best by the Federal government, which already has agencies equipped to manage them. If left to the State of Utah alone, the scale and cost of their managing would cause current protections to be compromised in order to even afford the effort it takes to maintain them. These public lands are our legacy and birthright as Americans, not just for Utahns, and not for private interests!	0	\N	\N	\N

135	DOI-2017-0002-0135	2017-05-11	I feel that it is absolutely imperative that we leave the National Monuments in place.  Allowing a President to designate these special places for all Americans is essential for the protection of our PUBLIC lands.  (In this case not Utah's).  With respect to the Bears Ears, I grew up in the Mountain West and have many relatives in Utah that go back to the original Mormon settlers.  I understand the western mentality towards those lands - protective with a sense of ownership.  However, particularly in respect to Bears Ears - I have spent many weeks traveling in the area.  About 5 years ago, I assisted some archaeologists update a survey that was completed in the 60's in the Bears Ears.  I, personally had traveled in the area in the 70's.  What we found was disheartening.  Many sites were damaged or vandalized, either by ignorance or sheer malevolence. I was sworn to secrecy when shown "special" places.  We hiked in spread out, so we would not leave a trail.  It is hard to find anything without damage, graffiti, or bullet holes.  I am a supporter of the NRA and have spent a fair amount of time four-wheeling there - but on designated roads and trails.  That is not happening any more.

154	DOI-2017-0002-0154	2017-05-11	I find it very alarming that you are considering any changes to our National Monuments.  We who live in the West value the scenic value, the enjoyment and history of the places set aside for the public to appreciate.  We also value the spiritual aspects of such sites as Bears Ears, Canyon of the Ancients for Indian tribes whose history predates that of those who came after.  To turn these places, set aside by former presidents for their intrinsic value, into areas where people can pillage, waste, and use for commercial purposes is not acceptable. We in the West have endured more than a century of mining that has left many areas of our country a polluted wasteland. To often the land is used, abused, and deserted. Nor is it acceptable to turn every square foot of our outdoors into play lands for those who have no intention of caring about the fragility environments, or honor the value of antiquities. I do not think that it is worthy of the current administration to consider changing that which was put in place by past presidents. If the National Monuments go, do we need to worry about our National Parks being turned into places for commercial gain?  Such thinking would leave nothing for the future generations.	0	\N	\N	\N

158	DOI-2017-0002-0158	2017-05-11	I am in favor of Bears Ears National Monument and want to see the Presidential Proclamation that created it on December 28, 2016 fully implemented, funded and upheld. Please do not shrink or entirely rescind the monument, let it stay as is.\n\nMy position is based in being a lifetime Utahn, with family roots in the central, rural parts. My grandfather on one side was a coal miner and the other a public lands sheep herder and federal trapper. I consider conservation a good thing for Utah: after all, we're a conservative state and want to keep things the way they are. What this doesn't mean is that we place our heads in the sand and ignore economic and social change happening all around us. It's 2017, the world has changed dramatically since my grandparent's generation only took natural resources from our collective public lands. It's time we stop placing priority on public lands ranching and mineral extraction as the only solution for jobs, and instead invest aggressively in the long-term stability that these lands offer -- stability with a basis in "if we protect it, they will come." \nAs Secretary Zinke himself explained more than once during his review visit to Utah, this place is "drop-dead gorgeous." He's right, and southern Utah is consistently setting records for visitation. (Ironically, this uptick in visitation is largely due to the state of Utah's internationally advertised "Mighty Five" campaign about our National Parks, four of which were proclaimed national monuments by an individual President before being elevated to park status). Because there's little water in Utah, this economic reality of visitation is our lifeblood, and protecting these lands is what will revive the economic vitality of towns like Blanding, much like it has Kanab, Escalante and Boulder at the edges of Grand Staircase-Escalante.\n\nAs for conservation, much of the land in Bears Ears is so remote, no permanent development can happen there -- its too uneconomical and too arid, a reality everyone in southern Utah has come to grips with a long time ago. All monuments are not created equal. This monument in particular is different in that it allows for continued uses, and even carves out a specific area for future uranium mining. Because Utah politicians could not reach agreement with all parties to get their legislative approach approved, the President stepped in to do their job for them. In fact, the Antiquities Act is in place for precisely these types of situations, much like the situation Theodore Roosevelt found himself in over a hundred years ago -- a dysfunctional Congress wouldn't act to protect lands in the national interest, so the President wielded his big stick and did it for them.\n\nThis monument is not about process at all. This monument is the result of Native American tribes reaching across historical animosities dating back well before white settlers came to this part of the country. The five tribes of the Bears Ears Inter-tribal Coalition put aside their differences around the common bond of connection to the land and the thousands of sacred sites their ancestors left behind, physically and spiritually. This is the most important point of my comment, Mr. Secretary. This is a historical opportunity for the United States of America to recognize the healing our country needs to undertake with the native people who lived here before we came and took their land. It's a matter of respect -- giving back some respect to people's we pushed into the most inhospitable of places in the American southwest. People still living in poverty who will likely not have much of a chance to participate in this comment period, simply because they have little connections to the internet or modern American society -- but they are still out there, living the only way they've ever known. You are their voice. This proclamation was specifically written to emphasize the continued native traditional uses of the public lands that keep their culture viable. Please let this country heal old wounds left over from colonialism -- we "whites" and all native people's are watching, and we all need a chance to begin healing a grave injustice. You are at a historical pinnacle to allow our nation to turn a corner that's long overdue. As an adopted son of native people, I would expect nothing less than keeping Bears Ears as is -- a monument to a nation respecting our diversity and acknowledging our collective history.\n\nWhile I respect the "traditional" uses of "local" residents of San Juan County, I do not respect a decision that is made entirely for only those people who came, conquered and continue to oppress their fellow human neighbors a short distance to the south. This should not be a decision at the insistence of a vocal minority represented by short-sighted, parochial Utah politicians.\n\nSincerely,\nDave Pacheco\n328 E Wilson Ave\nSalt Lake City, Utah     \n\n	0	\N	\N	\N

164	DOI-2017-0002-0164	2017-05-11	The notion that perhaps our nation is spending too much on national monuments and national parks is laughable and misguided.  Percentage-wise, this area is hardly a black hole of unlimited spending. But I think it's not the money that concerns the current administration: it's the protection offered by national monument status to fragile ecosystems, large tracts of undeveloped land, and the creatures that dwell there. Think about that for a minute. Are you willing to swap a short-term resource like oil or natural gas for the lives of many vulnerable and endangered species? Are you willing to set aside still more treaties with Native nations in order to engage in further rapacity? It seems to me that there is another way, a way that respects the earth, the people who live in and near national monuments, and the species of plants and animals for whom they are home: instead of extraction, how about renewable energy efforts that employ Native people? Finally, I argue for beauty, for open space, for deliberate gentle and non-invasive treatment of the lands currently protected with national monument and park designation. In themselves they are treasures; and they are perhaps the best antidote in this nation for our speedy, distracted, unnatural lives. I need nature to heal me, and I think we all do, whether we know it or not. I would ask that any review ask this question: How can we encourage Americans to visit this places, breathe in them, and cherish them?	0	\N	\N	\N

168	DOI-2017-0002-0168	2017-05-11	The establishment of National Monuments under the Antiquities Act are meant to protect the public from themselves.  Every National Monument that has been established was likely unpopular to certain portions of the population at the time of their establishment.  However, time has judged these decisions to be wise ones in hindsight and perhaps one of the greatest legacies of the presidents who proposed them.  What this EO seeks to do is review those monuments established since 1996 with the aim of de-listing certain monuments for the benefit of a few at the expense of the American people.  I for one, am opposed to this blatant hand-job to special interests.  If the GOP majorities in the House and Senate end up following through with the president's agenda, then all branches of the Federal Government will hopefully lose this round of Russian-roulette come mid-term elections.

People travel the world to see the beautiful red stone cliffs of Escalante Utah and, in time, the archeological treasures of the Bears Ears National Monument.  While I support keeping ALL the memorials established since 1996, due to their economic, historical and environmental benefit, I can speak more specifically to Escalante and Bears Ears in my home state of Utah.  While controversial, none were undertaken without extensive investigation into their costs and benefits for the region.  The benefits outweighed the costs and the monuments were established.  At least in Utah, those who advocated most strongly against the monuments were people engaged in energy extraction--high profits for a few; lasting environmental damage for everyone else.  Utah is littered with crude oil, coal and natural gas fields.  Saving these few national monuments for conservation, recreation, and heritage is beneficial to the region and our nation.  Please make the right choice.  Save our memorials!\n\nSincerely,\n\nJennifer Peeples	0	\N	\N	\N

178	DOI-2017-0002-0178	2017-05-11	Dear Mr Zinke,\n\n     For over 100 years Federal Lands have been held in trust for ALL AMERICANS, present and future.  Monuments like Bear's Ears and Escalante provide a level of space and solitude that are, frankly, no longer available in many National Parks.  Last spring I introduced my oldest daughter to the wonders of the south Utah desert.  After a crowded couple of days in and around Moab we set off in search of solitude.\n     We found it, far out the Burr Road in Wolverine Canyon in the Escalante National Monument.  The attached photo captures her emotions far greater than words can express.  She deserves to have the same opportunities to share a desert wilderness experience with her children.\n     I'm sure many will explain the economics of the situation: that southern Utah has far more to gain from sustainable ecotourism than it will ever gain from extractive industries.  I'm here to appeal to your sense of morality.  We are mere stewards of land that we have borrowed from our children and grandchildren.  Protect it.  Cherish it.  THAT is your mission.  Do the right thing.	1	\N	\N	\N
179	DOI-2017-0002-0179	2017-05-11	I would like to voice my support for continued protection of these National Monuments and retaining their designation, as well as condemn this review as a political move that does not take the people's real opinions into consideration. The continued protection and designation of Bear Ears NM is particularly important, as like many of the monuments it is the home of several Native tribes. Reducing the size or removing designation would be another instance of the US government taking advantage of and making decisions for tribes instead of the tribes and the people making decisions. It is a fundamental disruption and pointed attack to dismantle the Antiquities Act, which is such a quintessential part of American history and our American values.  As a resident of the western states that this affects as well as being employed in the outdoor industry, removing National Monument designation would have disastrous effects to both the land and the people. Please do not go forward with this review and allow all the monuments to keep their protected designation!	0	\N	\N	\N
180	DOI-2017-0002-0180	2017-05-11	As an active participant in a variety of outdoor recreation activities, I do not support the review of Bears Ears or the other National Monuments listed. These protected public lands have been designated as such through a well-defined process, and are uniquely American treasures that cannot be recovered once damaged by development or unprotected use.\n\nNational Monuments have already received extensive comment and review from surrounding communities. This deliberation can take years and even decades, and no designation has succeeded without strong local grassroots support. The idea that these National Monuments haven't received enough comment and review is not true. Additionally, protected lands are a tiny minority of all public lands. Of the 640 million acres of public land managed by the federal government, only about 12 million are protected as National Monuments. There is no good reason or economic need to review Monuments that have been expanded in the recent past.	0	\N	\N	\N

Pristine land is getting hard to find, and the harder it is to find the more it is needed by our society, whether we know it or not. People come from all over the world to enjoy our parks and monuments, one of America's best ideas.\n \nI am puzzled by the response of the Utah Representatives and Governor, a state that made special arrangements in the 2013 government shutdown to keep it's very heavily advertised parks open. I have to assume they did that because it was good for their economy. Senator Hatch said in 2014 "We owe a debt of gratitude to the people, both elected officials and citizens, who possessed the foresight to recognize the value of Canyonlands and created the park 50 years ago". I encourage you to be one of those people my grandchildren look back on in another 50 years and are thankful for.\n\nI have read about the struggles Teddy Roosevelt, Gifford Pinchot, Bob Marshall and others had creating the parks and public lands in Alaska. I have seen parts of them and they are spectacular. I am so thankful that they fought so hard to keep them for future generations. Please be one of the people that fights to maintain these special places.\n \nI understand that Bears Ears is very important to the native peoples, containing many sacred areas. I also understand it is a biodiversity hotspot, with many species of both flora and fauna. And I have also read that it is a fantastic area for climbing and hiking. We as a people need these areas, we need them to find peace, to relax, to be in touch with what is real.\n\nSince Teddy Roosevelt, just about every president has used the Antiquities Act to set aside land. This should not be a partisan issue, we all are grateful for the Grand Canyon, Muir Woods, Utah's Mighty Five, Olympic, Crater Lake....At least once we've seen them. Please, for the nation and the world, maintain Bears Ears and the other 26 monuments you are currently reviewing.\n\nThank you\n\n\n\n\n\n\n	0	\N	\N	\N
185	DOI-2017-0002-0185	2017-05-11	I am commenting about Rio Grande Del Norte  National Monument  in northern New Mexico to Taos County.  \n\n1)this national monument effort went on for almost 17 years and attempted a national conservation area of legislation for 16 of those 17 years.   There was widespread community support for this and has been supported by traditional users in the area including a land-grant, acequia and grazing permitee.   Hundreds of local businesses and individuals, many resolutions from surrounding communities including Taos County commission the mayor of Taos mayor of Questa mayor of Red River mayor of the Taos Ski Valley so many more organizations including multiple resolutions from Taos Chamber Of Commerce.   These resolutions and support letters came over the many years that this campaign had been actively seeking public land protection for the area.  Please see the Rio Grande Del Norte support book supplied by the coalition.  \n\n2) under the antiquities act all the areas that were designated under national monument designation had value under historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest"; values,   Please request this information from the resource management plan or at the Taos Bureau of land management office.   The object of value have been protected under this national monument designation.\n\n3)multiple use recreation has been A priority for the use of this national monument designation.   Hunters and fishermen, mountain bikers, ATV users, hikers outfitters and guides were all instrumental in supporting this designation within Taos County.   In December 2012 prior to the designation then secretary Kent Salazar visited Taos County to see the support that had been garnered over the years.  Secretary Salazar walked into a standing room only meeting at one of the local hotel conference room and was greeted with great gratitude with the idea of special protection for this area.   Please see the support park that highlight these media clips.\n\n4) all landowners that are bound within the national monument have complete access to their private lands within the national monument boundary.   Currently the New Mexico state land commissioner is looking to swap state lands within the boundary of the national monument for other BLM land there are more profitable to the state of New Mexico in other parts of the state.  Currently New Mexico state land commissioner is from the Conservative party  and supports this national monument.  Please see the support book with  State land commissioner Aubrey Dunn's media clip supporting the national monument and opposing any review of the Rio Grande Del Norte National Monument.\n\n5)Over the years this monument had been supported by state, local and tribal elected officials on multiple occasions.   Please see the support book with all of the resolutions that had been secured over the multiple congresses that this effort had been going on.\n\n6) Currently the Taos field office for the Bureau of Land Management has had the ability to manage the national monument since it's designation in 2013.   Currently the national monument has a National Monument Manager, Wildlife Biologist and many recreational staffers who manages the landscape for the enjoyment of all users.   Although the Bureau of Land Management could use additional staff that is a common theme across all federal agencies within the federal government; however BLM has done a fantastic job with supporting and managing the area with the personnel resources that they currently have on the ground; however BLM has done a  terrific job with supporting and managing the area with the personnel resources that they currently have on the ground.\n\nMr. Secretary Zinke:  I hope you do a thorough review of the Rio Grande Del Norte National Monument and recognize that there has been a widespread community support for the designation that both tribal local and state support has been garnered for this designation and the ability for multiple use has been recognized prior to this designation of the Rio Grande Del Norte national monument.\n	0	\N	\N	\N

188	DOI-2017-0002-0188	2017-05-11	The new Katahdin Woods and Water National Monument is incredibly exciting for Maine.  The Quimby Family and in particular Lucas St. Clair have worked YEARS with the community in the area to first purchase the land for protection and then sit with the community members and find out the best means to administer the land. They then set aside money for an endowment to maintain the park realizing that most national monuments do not have the funds to maintain themselves.  This work was done deliberating and thoughtfully with public input along the way in much the same way Acadia National Park was founded. It would be tragic to walk back on the hard work this philanthropic family put forth to benefit our state and environment in order to what?  That land was not being used prior to being purchases (at market value) and will revert to private ownership again if the monument is gone. Businesses that have started to spring up around the monument are now wondering about their viability and I know many families (including us) that are planning on going this summer.  We need and want this Monument in Maine despite what our Governor said in DC last week - he didn't even know the size of the tourist industry here or how beautiful that area of Maine is as he only mentioned the mosquitoes.

190	DOI-2017-0002-0190	2017-05-11	As a Grand Junction, Colorado resident, I regularly travel to southeastern Utah and southwestern Colorado for hiking and exploration of the canyon country. I've lived in Colorado since 1966, and when I was young, my family traveled to Lake Powell, Arches, and Mesa Verde on vacation trips. I have a deep appreciation for national parks, monuments and public BLM lands in this region.\n\nHistory shows that in the early 1950s, Congress delisted several national monuments in the West, including Colorado's Mount of the Holy Cross and Wheeler National Monuments, and Wyoming's Shoshone Caverns National Monument. Reasons for delisting these special places were sketchy at best - Wheeler, a remarkable stone wonderland in the San Juan Mountains, was said to be "too difficult to reach" by the public. These lands reverted to BLM or USFS lands and one Monument, Shoshone Caverns, was forever damaged and altered through particularly poor use practices, first by a private concessionaire hired by the City of Cody to develop the cave for public tours, later by inattention by the managing BLM when the City gave the cave back.\n\nRemoving or altering any of the national monuments on the list under current consideration by the Department of Interior without Congressional action and approval is unprecedented in our nation's history. Since the 1950s, even Congress has not delisted any federal monuments, in that the legislature recognizes the value of tourism and public access. Providing public lands to private interests for grazing, mining and other uses for personal gain is equal to giving away America's rich heritage.\n\nNational monuments provide plenty of profit for nearby businesses. Here at Grand Junction, Colorado National Monument provides jobs through park visitors who come to the city for lodging, meals and supplies. Other communities, including Blanding and Boulder, Utah, also receive financial benefits through the tourism and outdoor recreation dollar. \n\nHaving visited southeastern Utah in the early 1970s and again in recent years, it is exceptionally clear the value of tourism has to communities. Moab was a dusty, dirty town when I first visited it in 1972, with broad streets that were mostly empty of traffic. Today, the city is packed with visitors to the nearby national parks and monuments and the people who serve visitors.\n\nLet's not drop national monuments for short-sighted financial gain of a few economically-backward interests.	0	\N	\N	\N

I hope who ever reads this will have an open heart and mind.  when i heard that the Bears Ears could possibly become a monument, i was literally sick to my stomach, i really couldn't even believe that our former President would HONESTLY think that taking 1.3 million acres and putting it in a monument would be OK.   Let me tell you a little about my life growing up in Blanding Utah.  My dad worked for the county road department for years and his job was to run a blade/grader and maintain the county roads,  well that involved the Elk Mountain.  (this is what we grew up knowing the mountain as.  it wasn't BEARS EARS.  my dad got to spend a lot of time up on the Elk and the minute he would get done with work for the week, we would pack up our single cab pickup with camping supplies and head to the mountain to camp for the weekend.  This was the highlight of our lives, we couldn't wait to get up there and set up camp and listen to all my dads stories of what he saw during his work week,  my dad taught us so many things on that mountain.  I will never forget the times when ever we would see a rock in the road that could potentially pop a persons tire, my dad would stop the pickup and have one of us go out and move the rock.  I took in everything i could from those experiences, i loved the mountain and i can pretty much tell you where every road up there goes, I can tell you all the names of all the places up there because my dad taught us to respect the land and love it.  For the people of San Juan County being able to escape the troubles of the world and be able to head to the mountain is such a blessing to have.  i have followed my dads tradition and started taking my children camping, 4wheeling, hunting and they don't want to go to the mall, or the city when i ask them what they want to do without hesitation, it is always lets go to the mountain.  I was so impressed with Secretary Zinke while he was here in Blanding meeting and LISTENING to LOCALS young and old i truly thought he cared and was concerned.  I am 100% against this monument,  it will not do any good what so ever the land was already protected and the people of the county have taken great care of it that is why it is so pristine BECAUSE WE CARE!!  we love to camp, hunt, recreate, we rely on the mountain for our water, we rely on the mountain for wood to heat our homes, and to be honest we need it to unwind from the craziness of the world.  please don't take all this land away from the good people here.    these mountains have been here for ever, and people were welcome to come and explore them, they were never told they couldn't come but now since people have made a big hype over BEARS EARS people are flooding in.  the roads up there are very dangerous especially to out of towners that are not familiar with the area .  flash floods can come in less than a minutes notice, and lets be honest there is not many ruins on the mountain itself.  Cedar Mesa is where people want to explore so why not make that the monument and leave the mountains alone. we have so many families that run their cows on the mountain and to cut them out would be devastating the them.  lets please not fix something that has NEVER BEEN BROKEN leave it alone let us keep enjoying it lets let our children, grandchildren, great grand children be able to enjoy this beautiful area the way i did as a kid.  Rescind this monument we don't want it we never did, we were shunned when Sally Jewel came, she so was WAY more concerned about what the people that were bused in from who knows where.  When asked where Bears Ears were they couldn't tell ya cause they had no idea.  they were paid to come here and help the environmentalist it was the sickest day of my life.  again i feel that secretary Zinke's eyes were opened and can see this is a ridiculous amount of acreage to throw into a monument and hopefully he can address that with President Trump and we can get this monument RESCINDED  PLEASE HAVE SOME INTEGRITY AND MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE	0	\N	\N	\N

By designating land as a national monument, it makes it more accessible to the public, so that the land may be used by millions of people for generations to come.  This is truly what makes America great.  All of these national monument designations have been a way to return land to the public -- to every American.  By removing National Monument status from parks like Bears Ears and Berryessa, countless Americans will be denied access.  Under no circumstances should monument status be repealed.  If anything, additional National Monuments should be established, to ensure protection of land for future generations.\n	0	\N	\N	\N
202	DOI-2017-0002-0202	2017-05-12	My name is Nicole Francom and I have been a lifetime resident of San Juan County and have a deep love for this land.  I am extremely concerned about the Bear's Ears National Monument and am opposed to outside uninformed parties dictating the future of our home.  My husband and I have five beautiful children who have grown up hiking and experiencing the rich heritage of this area.  They have been taught to love, respect and care for the land.  I care enough about my children's future to join the fight against this greedy land grab by outside uninformed and politically motivated parties.  \n\nI believe that the National Monument is a serious overreach and an abuse of the intent and language of the Antiquities Act.  There are many compelling reasons why a National Monument designation would be disaster for the preservation of this remarkable area and also to the local community, both Caucasian and Native American.\n\nAll parties agree that this pristine and primitive land needs to be preserved and protected from vandalism and over-use.  I find it interesting that between 2011-2015, only 25 cases of vandalism were reported in San Juan County as compared to over 1,400 in the Grand Staircase National Monument in 2015 alone.  While people can point to a few cases of unfortunate vandalism in San Juan, this is minor to what will happen if hundreds of thousands of tourists flock to our mountains and canyons.  Sally Jewell's token visit to our unspoiled Bear's Ears mountain resulted in unsightly trash, trampled grass and ugly ruts in the muddy meadow.  This beautiful, sacred site was desecrated by people who "love", this area (but have never been here before and have no interest in taking care of it). \n\nWe love living in a small, rural community and choose to be here to raise our children with small town values and lifestyle.  While we don't begrudge people visiting our vast federal lands, we have no interest in our community becoming a tourist mecca complete with increased crime and commercialism.  Both local Caucasian and Native American residents share this view.  We have no interest in this frightening possibility and no interest in the likelihood of the commercialization of the mountain.  Before the Monument this area had little traffic and was quite wild and primitive.  It has already had increased numbers of people who have left trash, and have been stuck on unfamiliar roads to them.  We don't look forward to park rangers, gates, entry fees, picnic tables, visitor centers and parking lots defacing this beautiful place.  \n\nOur community is over half Native American and while environmental groups have manipulated out of county Native American groups to promote their agendas, locals know they are being used.  The majority of San Juan Native Americans are alarmed at the prospect of a National Monument as they know it will be an end to another chapter in their loss of culture and another broken promise by the federal government.  \n\nThank you for your commitment to fairness and what is in the best interest of not only your constituents, but to this amazing land that needs to be protected for future generations. Rescind Bears Ears!\n\nSincerely,\nNicole Francom	0	\N	\N	\N

221	DOI-2017-0002-0221	2017-05-12	Excerpted from the letter from the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition to Ryan Zinke, Secretary of the Interior: The Bears Ears National Monument is the first national monument to be protected at the behest of sovereign Tribal Nations. Its proclamation recognizes Native American Traditional Knowledge as both a value to be protected by the monument and a resource to be used in its management. The proclamation also established a Tribal commission to work with the U.S. Government to help plan for and manage the lands. The Bears Ears Commission has been formalized and has already began meeting with federal land managers.\nPlease do not renege on this important agreement with the sovereign nations who trusted the U.S. Government.	0	\N	\N	\N

215	DOI-2017-0002-0215	2017-05-12	Please retain all the national monuments with their existing boundaries.  We have visited the area of Bears Ears National Monument, both the northern panhandle and the southern part including Cedar Mesa and Comb Ridge.  We stayed in commercial lodgings in Moab and Bluff.  I (George) first saw the northern part in 1966.  All of BENM deserves monument status for its outstanding natural values and for its Native American historical values.  We would be opposed to any deletions from the boundaries.  Please concentrate the Interior Department's efforts on facilitating the exchange of SITLA parcels for public lands elsewhere in Utah without the outstanding values within BENM, to relieve the state school fund's concern about future income from its holdings.  We were disappointed to read in news media that Secretary Ryan Zinke spent most of his time in Utah with opponents of the national monument, and little with the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition and local advocates of the monument.  When former Secretary Sally Jewell was considering the monument proposal last year, she met with county commissioners, state officials, and with proponents of the monument.  The Secretary should consider information from all sides, without bias or favor.  We will submit further comments at a later date.  Thank you for considering our thoughts.	0	\N	\N	\N
216	DOI-2017-0002-0216	2017-05-12	I am in favor of the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase National Monuments being rescinded.\nThis is not what the antiquities act was put in place for. A simple pen stroke and declaration by someone who has never visited the land is not the way these things should be done.  Input from local governing entities should not just be heard, but should be vital to the process and should be followed to a very large degree, if not entirely.  These groups of elected officials, county commissions and city councils, are the voice of those they are elected to represent, they are the voices of those that these designations impact most directly.\nAnother reason these monument designations should be rescinded is the effect they have on those who use the land in positive ways.  Whether it is for recreation or whether they use it to make a living to support their family.\nThe final reason I will discuss here is the impact that it has on the land itself.  Those in favor of these monuments will say it is to protect the land; that is the exact opposite of what they actually do.  The designation of a National Monument draws hundreds of thousands of people to the land, people who do not live in the areas surrounding these monuments, and people who visit the land for a short time and then leave, in many cases never to return.  Typically, these people will not treat the land with the same respect as those who live near it and use the land repeatedly.  We that live here and use it for recreational activities and use the land for businesses, including those businesses that use the land for tourism-related activities, work hard to protect the land, and treat the land with the respect it deserves as they show tourists all that this area has to offer.  We that live here want the land to be treated well and to be protected, so that it stays in pristine condition for us, and our families and for others for years to come.  National Monuments do not provide this protection!  Please protect the land; rescind these National Monuments!	0	\N	\N	\N

233	DOI-2017-0002-0233	2017-05-12	I have lived in Blanding Utah my entire life.  I have hiked and hunted the hills, flats and canyons contained in this Bears Ears Monument.  I have gathered firewood on this land to keep my family warm in the winter.  We camp on the beautiful Blue Mountain that is literally in our backyard.  There is a lot of misinformation going on in regards to this topic.  There are areas within the monument that I agree need protection.  Down on the south end of the monument near the moki dugway, and areas on cedar mesa where there are multiple archaeological sites, ruins, etc.  Those small areas need protection and the BLM is already doing a fine job of that.  There are large areas on Bears Ears that are under the protection of the Forest Service and also a large wilderness area.  The forest service has managed these areas just fine for many years.  The only thing that designating a monument here has done is bring people by the hundreds, to an area not set up to handle these kinds of visitors.  It is remote, rugged, and mostly untouched.  It can be dangerous without the right kinds of vehicles, gear and preparation.  We have already seen higher numbers of injuries, and dehydration, from visitors coming to see the monument in our ER.  We want responsible usage and management of this land.  Declaring a monument of this size and magnitude without the proper planning and infrastructure is completely irresponsible.  Since the monument was designated, it has been the responsibility of the county and the locals to pull folks out of snow banks, help them dig their cars out, give them water because they are not prepared.  There is no infrastructure here to handle the influx of people who want to see this area.  This is not the way to promote access to this land.  Make the monument smaller, or rescind it completely, would make the most sense to me.  I appreciate Secretary Zinke coming to visit and have hope that he will be able to review this and make a decision that makes the most sense for all parties.  The locals don't want to keep people out, we just want to protect this land that we love and still be able to have access to it.  We want the native american people to be able to do their ceremonies and pick their herbs and gather firewood.  We want to be able to hunt it responsibly and keep our wild animal population healthy and thriving.  For those who are claiming that Utah lawmakers want the monument rescinded so they can exploit the gas and oil exploration, that is simply not true.  The area was mined and drilled many years ago and there is not enough to continue to mine and extract.  If there was, there would be active mines and wells on the monument now.  The area is too rugged and remote to be able to do those things.  No one is planning to develop the land, it is too remote.  There is very little water, and once again, no infrastructure to support those things.  We want the land to be kept as it is. We have been good stewards of this land for many years and will continue to do so for the good of the land that we love.  Please rescind the monument and let the BLM and forest service do what they have been doing.  Managing the land responsibly, keeping people safe.  There are multiple parks that visitors can come and enjoy that already have the proper management and infrastructure.  Visit Natural Bridges National Park.  Go drive through Monument Valley.  Spend the day at Arches National Park.  Go see the Grand Canyon. Hike to Firehouse Ruins, or Butler wash ruins. Visit the many trails and sites that are already set up all over this county.  Leave the rest of it to remain untouched and unexploited by tourism and recreation.  If a monument makes the most sense, make it small, do it responsibly.  Put it in an area that needs monument protection.  The rest of it just needs to be left as it is.\n	0	\N	\N	\N

248	DOI-2017-0002-0248	2017-05-12	This has obviously become a very political topic, which is a shame. The Bears Ears National Monument contains some of the most cultural significant landscapes on Earth. How it hasn't already received long term protection and the resources that come with it is shocking.  Furthermore, the current executive review seems to ignore the fact the boundary of the monument almost mirrors the boundaries established the in Public Lands Initiative -- a deal worked out by local entities but that failed to pass through congress.  Secretary Zinke claims to be listening but repeatedly failed to meet with locals that support the monument designation and with the spiritual leaders of the 5 tribes. Frankly, this public comment period seems like a head nod to democracy, in a reality where the Koch brother's have more influence here than the people who use and recreate on the land. \n\nMy family and I have visited Blanding and Bluff for vacation and work.  We have spent thousands of dollars in those communities because of the natural wonders of the area. Please protect this place in a way that allows for the existing land use to continue, but makes sure Bears Ears is set up for the future where visitation increases.  Please help maintain existing ATV trails where applicable.  Support the local ranching community, but you can do that while still maintaining the monument status. \n\nAlso, could someone in your fine agency please point out the optics of riding to his first day of work on a horse named Tonto to your fearless, borderline bigoted leader.

Our U.S. National Parks, National Monuments, and other protected public lands are a critical part of what makes America great already!\n\nThe Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument is gem among Oregon public lands.\n\nThe Monument is at the rare intersection of three mountain ranges, the Cascades, the Siskiyou, and the Klamath Mountains. The unique mix of plants and animals in the Monument makes it an unparalleled treasure of diversity.\n\nThe Monument is a perfect example of public lands supporting multiple uses.\n\nThe Monument supports a wide range of recreation, like hunting, fishing, driving, biking, bird and butterfly watching, mushroom hunting, and hiking, including along the Pacific Crest Trail. It also supports clean water, scientific research, educational programs, and is the beautiful mountain backdrop to Ashland and Talent, OR. Together, these uses are critical to Southern Oregon's growing tourism economy and all the jobs and taxes that result.\n\nThe Monument is widely supported throughout the local area.\n\nDuring its original designation and again when the Monument was expanded, it received overwhelming local support, including dozens of landowners with inholdings and bordering the Monument, local city councils, state and Tribal officials, the Governor, Representatives, and Senators. The list of thousands of supporters from surrounding communities and others across the U.S. is constantly growing.\n\nThe push to open the Monument is coming from outsiders.\n\nThe sole witness invited to the Republican-led congressional hearing on President Trump's plan to gut Monument protection was an out-of-state timber executive from a timber company headquartered outside the region. A special interest group of logging lobbyists from hundreds of miles away is leading the fight to kill the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument.\n\nIt's clear that rolling back Monument protection is only the first step in the extreme anti-public lands agenda of selling off America's treasures to corporations. We need to keep public lands in public hands. The first step is to leave all U.S. Monuments protected.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to comment, John Riha	0	\N	\N	\N

I have personally spent several thousand dollars in Utah that I would not have spent absent the protected public land in that state.  That is, Utah residents have benefited by several thousand dollars from me alone due to the existence of protected public lands, including the national monuments subject to this review.\n\nIn addition to the economic benefit that these protected public lands provide to the residents adjacent to the lands (including in Utah), protecting these lands provides an unmeasured benefit to future generations of Americans, who should be able to enjoy the lands in much the same way that we are currently able to.	0	\N	\N	\N

The unique mix of plants and animals in the Monument makes it an unparalleled treasure of diversity. \n\nThe Monument is a perfect example of public lands supporting multiple uses. \n\nThe Monument supports a wide range of recreation, like hunting, fishing, driving, biking, bird and butterfly watching, mushroom hunting, and hiking, including along the Pacific Crest Trail. It also supports clean water, scientific research, educational programs, and is the beautiful mountain backdrop to Ashland and Talent, OR. Together, these uses are critical to Southern Oregon's growing tourism economy and all the jobs and taxes that result. \n\nThe Monument is widely supported throughout the local area. \n\nDuring its original designation and again when the Monument was expanded, it received overwhelming local support, including dozens of landowners with inholdings and bordering the Monument, local city councils, state and Tribal officials, the Governor, Representatives, and Senators. The list of thousands of supporters from surrounding communities and others across the U.S. is constantly growing. \n\nThe push to open the Monument is coming from outsiders. \n\nThe sole witness invited to the Republican-led congressional hearing on President Trump's plan to gut Monument protection was an out-of-state timber executive from a timber company headquartered outside the region.

Protecting these lands from oil and gas exploration, giving them extra cultural protections and oversight and preserving them for generations to come is the responsibility of all of us.

The area encompassed by bears ears national monument is an amazing wild place that needs federal protection to preserve the beauty for future generations. It is an area I have enjoyed canyoneering in for many years. If you want an example of how Utah will manage it without a national monument designation look at the natural gas pipeline and abandoned rigs at dead horse point state park. They are terrible trash piles and eyesores that destroy an otherwise remote piece of beauty. No one cleans up after them when the natural resources are spent. The amount of jobs and local economy that will be created from tourism will vastly outnumber the oil and gas exploitations. Wild places in this country are becoming ever more scarce. Please protect Bears Ears and other national monuments in Utah including Grand Staircase-Escalante.\n\n\nChris Wilcox\n2904 Morgan dr.\nHolladay, UT 84124\n(801) 386-1874\nFiremedicwilcox@gmail.com 	0	\N	\N	\N

They fill us with a great pride and are a treasured American joy. Tourism to these areas continuously boosts industries and local economies. Travelers from all around our great nation and the world come to visit our vast and stunning landscapes. \n\nHaving been bestowed with the designation of National Monument is an honor that these lands truly deserve and should not, under any circumstance, be rescinded. All 27 of these spaces deserve our protection and respect, so that they can be enjoyed by generations to come. I personally took a trip cross-country this past December just to visit over 6 National Monuments and am only sorry I was so close to Vermilion Cliffs and was unable to make it there. The Wave and White Pocket are two incredible formations that I am desperately looking forward to seeing someday.\n\nBears Ears National Monument is especially deserving of its designation. It is sacred tribal land that five different tribes have come together to ask for the protection of. The Federal Government should be respectful of the sacred value this land holds to these tribes. It is rare for so many to agree and come together on a single, unified issue. There is more to be gained from maintaining National Monument status than there is from rescinding it. Bears Ears is a unique formation and is surrounded by an incredible landscape. Families can and should be able to enjoy this lands in all seasons for years to come. This designation will bring tourism and boost the local economy.\n\nAllowing states to manage these types of lands offers weak protections for their preservation. The American people care more for our National Monuments and public lands than it's apparent our state officials do. The bills I've seen put forth in Congress that aim to return control to states would only harm these lands or serve them up as bargaining chips for large, non-environmentally friendly, corporations. These deals would destroy the sanctity of these precious spaces, acre by acre. Families who come to these lands to enjoy well deserved, and sometimes rare, time together might start to look elsewhere for their adventures. We must protect our great outdoors. Allow them to retain their designations so that we can continue to visit them, take pride in them, and continue to the tradition of honoring the unique beauty that America has to offer. 	0	\N	\N	\N

Bears Ears is a good example of the need to preserve scientific and cultural areas of national significance. \n\nThis designation was praised by the coalition of Native Americans and environmentalists who had led the campaign to protect the land. As Navajo Nation President Russell Begaye wrote that the president's decision will "protect this land as a national monument for future generations of Navajo people and for all Americans", while collaborative land management provisions "strengthened the relationship between our Navajo and American nations." Arizona state Representative Eric Descheenie, a member of the Navajo Nation, said "At the end of the day, there's only a certain place in this entire world, on earth, where we as indigenous peoples belong. And to be able to secure that, you can't put any money value on it."\n\nI believe that the establishment of the monument was also praised by the Mormon Environmental Stewardship Alliance.\n\nThe decision to question the value of this and the other monuments is a rank partisan power-play.\n\nWe will probably all be dead when the American people will thank those who created these monuments and will curse those who let them slip away.\n\n	0	\N	\N	\N

Since its inception as a national monument in 1996, amazing dinosaur discoveries have been made by scientists from the Bureau of Land Management, with help from the Escalante Partners. If this becomes no longer protected, amateur fossil hunters will exploit the land and mishandle fossil treasures. When fossils are appropriately removed from the ground, there is a systematic process that must take place in order to best understand dinasour behavior, ecosystems that the animals lived in, and how populations moved. To date, the BLM scientist have identified at least 20 new dinasour species since 2000.\n\nThere are also countless ruins of Anasazi Indians that date back to 700AD. If the Grand Staircase and other Utah monuments are left unprotected, these existing cliff dwellings, petroglyphs, and artifacts will be destroyed and no long available for future generations to observe in a natural setting.\n\nI urge our congressmen and senators to act to help protects these natural treasures in Utah.\n\nSincerely,\nJody Amacher	0	\N	\N	\N

I am specifically visiting Glacier National Park this summer because in another few decades, there might not actually be any glaciers left. We don't need to be taking away protection from public lands, parks, monuments and the like - we need to be expanding our protection of them! The United States Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld presidential proclamations under the Antiquities Act, ruling each time that the Act gives the president nearly-unfettered discretion as to the nature of the object to be protected and the size of the area reserved. Since 1906, the Antiquities Act has enabled the President to set aside land of historical or scientific value. Several opinions by attorneys general and solicitors "strongly suggest the president doesn't have this authority to rescind" a national monument designation, says Robert Keiter, a law professor at the University of Utah and director of the Wallace Stegner Center for Land, Resources, and the Environment. "Most legal scholars that have looked at it have concluded the same." Some presidents have reduced the size of monuments, but none of those reductions were ever challenged in court, so there is no legal opinion on whether presidents actually had the power to make them. And all of them occurred prior to the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, which some experts believe more explicitly limits presidential powers to revoke or change monuments. \n\nWe should not be shrinking the size of protected lands. Please preserve them for now and future generations.\n\nsource - http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2017/0426/Can-the-president-shrink-or-even-eliminate-national-monuments	0	\N	\N	\N

Unspoiled outdoors locations, such as found at Bears Ears or the Marine Reserve are key for the future of our nation. We need wilderness to keep us sane, and to maintain species diversity and health. Destruction of the outdoors heritage is destroying this irreplaceable resource for future generations. Our grandchildren and great-grandchildren need these refuges and the biodiversity. Monument designations maintain these resources for all of us and our future, rather than sacrificing them to the short-term needs and desires of a wealthy, greedy few. SAVE OUR MONUMENTS FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS, AND DO NOT OPEN THEM TO DEVELOPMENT. \n\nIf the outdoors can only be viewed through an economic lens, then consider the financial value of this resource for future tourists, and for Americans who want to remember what once existed in the country. Biodiversity is key for the development of new drugs, since the chemical constituents of many plants remain unexamined, and their potential for medicine untapped. \n\nI feel passionately about this issue, and the Department of the Interior should be focusing on maintaining our wilderness, not removing these monument designations. If you destroy these places, your names will be infamous, and future generations will remember you with disgust. Plus, the short comment period on this federal action is offensive. \n\nDr. Susan J.

While I understand my horrible representatives in the great state of Utah want to drill baby drill, I ask that you not allow this. These lands are sacred and deserved to be protected. We are much better off saving this land for generations to come rather than destroying it. Let's not be short-sighted because a couple of old white guys want to retire.

332	DOI-2017-0002-0332	2017-05-12	My name is Genevieve Mitchell.  I am Navajo, Dine', from the Nation Nation.  My parents and ancestors are from different areas of the reservation.  My mother's families are from parts around the Ganado and Window Rock area in Arizona.  My father's families are from the Shiprock and Aneth area of New Mexico and Utah.  My late paternal grandfater, John Mitchell Sr., is from Aneth, Utah.  He was a medicine man practicing many of our traditional ways.  He was very respected in the community.  I have learned within the past 2 years of the controversy of the proposal by different Environmental Organization groups to push the Bear Ears area in the attempt to have the United States, designate the area as a national monument.  These groups have claimed they are assisting a grassroots group of Native Americans to push for the designation.  While researching I couldn't help but to think of one person.  Stella Peshlakai Smith.  I read about Stella a few years ago.  Her story was heartbreaking.  She was born in an area that was designated Wupatki National Monument in 1924.  Stella is Navajo.  Her father and many other Navajos have resided in this area after they returned from Bosque Redondo, a time we call Hweeldi, The Suffering, but better known as The Long Walk.  Once the national monument was designated the park service restricted a lot of things the Navajos could do in this area.  Making it near impossible to continue their way of life.  Sheep has always been a way of life for our Navajo people.  The people in Wupatki were restricted, they slowly started moving off the national monument because of this.  Stella stayed.  She continued her way of life, only to find that her children and grandchildren are exempt from calling this area home due to the designation.  Her "permit" to continue to live here did not apply to her children and grandchildren.  Once Stella passes into the spirit world.  So does her permit.  Therefore, no one will ever call this place with so much cultural and ancestry, home.  Many people that have the same type of way of life would have the same restrictions.  Not only my Dine' people but people who have call the areas around Bears Ears home for generations.  The stewards of these areas will be restricted.\n\nKnowing this fact, I have the stance and spirit to say, I am against the Bears Ears National Monument.  My Dine' brothers and sisters, friends and family in this area will be affected.  The people that are wanting the designation argue that there are ancient sites in these areas that need to be protected.  What they fail to cite is, the list of multiple federal laws that have been established to ensure the protection of these sites and the way of a national monument was unnecessary and clearly an abuse of power made by the 44th president of the United States.  One can simply read The Antiquities Act to make this determination.  Though I understand there is a difference between Wupatki and Bear Ears, the restrictions will still be the same for people who live and sustain a way of life WITH the land.  It is stated in the proposals that the Native Americans will have access to the area.  My question is, what will the future generations of my people have access to?  There is no guarantee that our future children will be able to access the land. We know there is no absolute guarantee, but our history is proof of what could and would happen.  Our history, our teachings, our upbringing, our beliefs come from many different places but it is emphasized in many, to care for and to respect the land.  Without access how can we continue to teach this?  Where will our future generations go to collect the resources they need for their prayers?  Our Navajo people are already struggling.  My Navajo people have already been restricted enough to land that they have ties to.\n\nI, as a member of the Navajo Nation, with ancestors tied to different regions to Dinetah, the "Navajo reservation", am opposed to the Bears Ears National Monument.	0	\N	\N	\N

Bears Ears is exactly the kind of place the Antiquities Act intended to protect.

Senator Orrin Hatch was quoted saying before the U.S. Congress, it was "the mother of all land grabs." A belief he still holds onto.\nThe Antiquities Act gives the president authority to create national monuments. \n"The record is undisputed that the President of the United States used his authority under the Antiquities Act to designate the Grand Staircase Monument," wrote Benson in his 47-page ruling.\nBenson called the Antiquities Act a "proper constitutional grant of authority to the President" and added that the courts do not have the authority to determine whether Clinton abused his discretion under the act.\nThe opposition argued in court that Clinton violated the Antiquities Act by designating too much of the area for protection. The act requires a president to designate the smallest area possible to preserve a national treasure.\nAs stated in Presidential Proclamation 6920, dated Sept. 18, 1996: "The Federal land and interests in land reserved consist of approximately 1.7 million acres, which is the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected." The courts concur. There should be no reduction in the size of Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument.	0	\N	\N	\N

341	DOI-2017-0002-0341	2017-05-12	I  am most concerned about removing National Monument status to any of our National Monuments.  Of the 129 National Monuments, I have been to 25 of them, those that are mostly located in the western portion of the US where I reside.  Each and everyone of the monuments I have visited have natural wonders that could easily be destroyed by people or industry if not protected by National Monument status.  Once these national treasures/wonders are destroyed, there is no return.\n\nI have not had the pleasure of yet to visit Bears Ears in Utah.  What I can tell you is that I have visited all the National Parks, and most of the National Monuments in Utah.  Utah is such a unique landscape of diversity.  It is amazing how the landscape changes within a few miles.  If a person has not visited, and by that I mean get out of the car and walk and hike these amazing places, how can one determine their status?  One cannot.  A single day visit by Zinke does not reveal the wonder of these monuments.  \n\nGrand Staircase-Escalante is another site being visited by Zinke.  I spent a week there and did not get to see half of what there is to enjoy.  A one day visit there does not provide the depth of the wonders of that monument.\n\nAgain, you can never replace these incredible natural landscapes once you allow industry to devour them.  To remove their protection opens them up for ruin.  I could spend an inordinate amount of time describing the magnificent wonders of the National Monuments I have had the pleasure to visit.  I will not.  I will suffice it to say, PLEASE, for this generation and all the future generations, do not give in to the "almighty dollar" in lieu of protecting our national treasures.  There a many National Monuments that I have not yet visited, so I cannot attest to them.  However, they were created for a purpose, and that is to protect and preserve.\n\nTo remove National Monuments from protection is tantamount to what Isis did when it torn down and destroyed sculptures.  Has our government stooped so low as to do the same to our national treasures.  I pray not.\n\nThank you for taking the time to ready my message. \n	0	\N	\N	\N

399	DOI-2017-0002-0399	2017-05-12	Hello, my name is Kim Henderson and I am a 3rd generation San Juan County resident.  I've lived 30 out of the 40 years of my life in SJC, Utah.  I lived outside SJC for 10 years, after graduating High School, in which time I married and had 4 out of 5 of my children.   My husband, 4 children and I moved to Monticello, my home town in 2006. My husband was born and raised in the SL. valley, but fell in love with Monticello after his 1st visit.  He loved the small town atmosphere and close community.  We decided, we wanted our children to be raised in beautiful, small, safe SJC!  After living in a bigger city for 10 years, I craved the simple, small town life I grew up in.  Most of my childhood memories include the beautiful Mountains and land that surround SJC.   Nothing is better than being able to drive a short distance and be in absolute quiet and solitude.  \n After hearing about the Bears Ears NM proposal, my heart broke!  What would happen to our wonderful SJC?  A big fear is that SJC will turn into another Moab.  Thousands of tourists every year.  Visiting SJC beautiful, sacred areas, and leaving many footprints and much destruction behind. There has been huge confusion amongst SJC locals in why a monument designation is necessary in a place that is already managed by the BLM and Forest Service?  As residents of SJC we were told that when Sec Sally Jewell visited last summer, we (the residents) would have an opportunity to voice our concerns.  There was a meeting in Bluff Utah where Sec Jewell would listen to local concerns.  What a slap in the face that was!!  Upon arrival, it was obvious that local voices would not be heard.  Hundreds of out of state people has been bused in to Bluff to drown out the local voices of opposition and make it look as SJC was in favor of the monument!  To make things worse, we the local people learned we were up against BIG special interest and environmental groups that have millions of $ to support the Bears Ears NM.  The majority of open forms and discussion on the monument were held at least 5 hours away in SL city or farther in Washington DC.  Many of us locals made long up and back one day trips to the Utah St capital to voice our opposition of Bears Ears NM.  We traveled on our own $. It was very discouraging to arrive at the St Captiol to find paid protesters, a lot of which have never even been to SJC let alone the Bears Ears region.  We were met with insults and yelling from these same people saying " SJC just wants the land to be drilled"! "SJC is anti public lands"! Etc etc.  Even though we knew we were up against big $ groups, I held out hope that this 1.9 million acre monument proposal would not happen.  After all the Antiquities Act States "the smallest amount of land". Plus Sally Jewell went in record saying she would not recommend the monument with out large local buy in.  The majority of San Juan County both Native and Anglo strongly oppose the monument!  Despite these two huge facts on our side, Forner Pres Obama ingnored the voices of SJC!  How did this happen!  Our beautiful county has been exploited and will be over run within tourist looking to check another box on their quest to visit all the NM and NP!  I've seen it in the other Monuments and Parks surrounding SJC.  When the monument management feels there is too much foot traffic in trails and roads, things will slowly be shut off and restricted!:(. \n\nPres Trump and Sec Zinke, please rescind the Bears Ears NM.  The proces in which is was designated, was obviously abuse of the Antiquities Act!  This can not be allowed to stand.  My Family has faith that the Trump administration will right this wrong!  \n Please save SJC, Utah!\n\nSincerely, Kim Henderson \nSJC resident	4	\N	\N	\N
347	DOI-2017-0002-0347	2017-05-12	I oppose the review of these and any national monuments, as well as any potential reductions in their boundaries or the protections granted to their ecosystems. The Antiquities Act is a valuable piece of legislation because it confers permanent protection to our nation's most valuable, and often most fragile, landscapes. Any threat to the permanence of a monument declaration is a threat to the potency of the Act, and would severely limit the president's power to protect the lands that he, as the chief executive, is tasked with defending. Additionally, national monuments are only declared after long periods of consultation with any and all affected parties, input from the people of the United States (who, together, are the owners of the federal lands subject to the Antiquities Act), and thorough examination of the economic, scientific, and cultural ramifications of a declaration. To undo this process would be damaging to the American people and the American landscape. The result of subjecting national monuments to review would undoubtedly be the permanent loss of irreplaceable parts of our country. Of special concern in this review is the new and often controversial Bears Ears monument. There can be no doubt that Bears Ears contains one of the nation's most significant reservoirs of local Native American history and culture, and there can also be no doubt that, before monument designation, this culture was under constant threat of vandalism, theft, and destruction. Beyond its cultural significance, the Bears Ears monument provides sorely needed protections for a fragile ecosystem that could not withstand the division and degradation that would result from industrial or commercial development. No amount of economic gain, most of which would likely accrue to a few out of state developers, could make up for the loss of cultural, environmental, and, indeed, even economic (in the form of recreation and tourism) benefits that a national monument provides. America needs Bears Ears, and America has expressed that it wants Bears Ears to be protected permanently. Do not undo the momentous achievement that is Bears Ears National Monument.	0	\N	\N	\N

Vandalism, desecration, littering all skyrocket in federally designated areas. Looting is bound to increasere artifacts and pottery shards everywhere. I'm sure many would love to take home a "souvenir." A monument will do the exact opposite of what proponents are hoping it will do.  When those sort of activities occur, restrictions and closures are bound to happen. San Juan County cannot have that for us to continue our way of life and keep the dynamic of our communities. We do not want to risk changes to our livelihoods.  We do not want to depend on seasonal, tourism. Those jobs cannot support families.  We look to Garfield County as an example of what could happen.  Thank you for visiting San Juan County and looking out for rural America. We need protected too.\n\nSara Flannery\n	0	\N	\N	\N

355	DOI-2017-0002-0355	2017-05-12	Monuments are economic drivers for many communities across the country. I make a point to travel to new monuments because I'm intrigued by what made them special enough for a President of the United States to use the Antiquities Act to preserve them for future generations. Each one is special and tells a unique story. \n\nThe Antiquities Act was signed by President Teddy Roosevelt in 1906 to safeguard and preserve U.S. public lands and cultural and historical sites for all Americans to enjoy.  Sixteen presidents - eight Republicans and eight Democrats - have used this authority to protect places in Arizona and across the country. My favorite places in Arizona started as monuments - like the Grand Canyon and Saguaro NP. \n\nPlease don't take away what citizens of the United States have worked so hard to achieve at points in time that were particular to that presidency. I'm particularly concerned about Bears Ears, just across the Arizona border in Utah. The years of public process to bring together all the native american communities with recreationists, businesses and community leaders needs to be recognized.  \n\nPlease leave our monuments just as they are. \n\n	1	\N	\N	\N

National Monument Status protects our lands as resources to be cherished, appreciated, gleaned from in all ways except the antiquated misuse of lands that is resource extraction in our world today. Myself and the American people overwhelmingly consider that not only do we need to protect our wild places and natural splendor, we also need to move beyond an economy that is centered around the destruction of our natural world rather than working with it in sustainable ways that supports our modern way of life. It is possible. We have the technology, the willpower, the intelligence, and then necessity to do so. \nThank you\nMatthew Van BIene	0	\N	\N	\N

I have been working tirelessly with my friends, family, neighbors, tribal members, and elected officials to have our voice heard that this gluttonous land grab, fueled and funded by extreme special interest groups is NOT in the interest of Utah Constituents in San Juan County, is NOT in the interest of traditional Native practices, and is certainly NOT in the interest of a self-sufficient American way of life. \n\nThe short 5 months following the designation has produced the OPPOSITE OF PROTECTION and this monument should be rescinded quickly before more damage comes. From a Native American perspective, land thrives from freedom and responsible use- the way Mother Earth intended; and certainly not smothered with layers of bribed "managers" aka tribal leaders who have yet to learn to manage their current obligations, and big check writing extremists who claim to want to help Native Americans, but ignore the needs of the people. \n\nI am absolutely in favor of the prospect that Bears Ears could be rescinded and to have the Antiquities Act reviewed in a way that it serves the Constitution instead of being used without discretion to undermine the Constitution. I was very pleased to see 20 years worth of Federal Monuments added to the list along with Bear's Ears.

410	DOI-2017-0002-0410	2017-05-12	A few months ago I read that Gold Butte was not going to be considered for reversal because "the state of Nevada (Harry Reid) supported it". At the time the Monument was designated, Nevada was being held captive by the least popular senator of all time, Harry Reid. The only people who voted for Harry were "city people" in the union strongholds of  Las Vegas & Reno. The unions told them to toe the Democratic Party line and they blindly did it. Harry then proceeded to ignore ALL of his constituents and play on the "national scene" supporting any and all radical ideas coming from the environmentalist lobby.\n\nI am an off-road enthusiast as are the vast majority of Nevada residents who don't live in public housing. I implore you to take another look at the fantastic back country scenery at Gold Butte and reopen it for the enjoyment of the underrepresented population in Rural Nevada.\n\nThanks for your consideration.	0	\N	\N	\N

It is obvious that special interests groups want to use our national lands for mining and/or fossil fuel extraction.  I say no!  We do not have too many National Monuments or to large.  If anything their should be more and they should be expanded.  The real greatness of America is not what we can yank from the earth destroying beauty, viable ecosystems, and culturally valuable treasures in the process but in the wisdom we posses and apply in protecting and preserving these irreplaceable gems.  If you listen to the will of the common people, the middle class, the native Americans, the scientists and others you can only reach one conclusion:  The National Monuments and Parks are important and treasured by so many on so many levels well beyond extracting materials for short-term greed.  \nHuman caused climate change is real.  An honest and unbiased exploration of the science, causes and the effects is overwhelming convincing that the future is going to be unstable, challenging and frightening.  We should be doing all we can to move away from fossil fuel extraction and usage.  President Obama did a courageous and wonderful thing in establishing new and valuable National Monuments.  Thanks to him and other presidents who have done so.  It would be wrong, irresponsible and unwise to rescind the status of these National Monuments.  To do so would be counter to the future greatness of America and the future well-being of our nation and our children.  KEEP, PROTECT AND EXPAND THE NATIONAL MONUMENTS THAT ENHANCE THE STRENGTH, THE WONDER AND THE DIVERSITY OF AMERICA.\n 	0	\N	\N	\N
390	DOI-2017-0002-0390	2017-05-12	I have been spending some time in the Bears Ears National Monument the past few months. The raw beauty and stillness is sublime...heart opening in a way that only those that have been there can understand. Within this monument's boundaries lie more than 100,000 archaeological sites. More than 13 tribes can trace their lineage to these lands. This National Monument is a celebration of Native American connections to the land. It is considered a "holy land" to these tribes. It is truly a sacred place.\n   There are not many places left on Earth that the hand of man has not scarred. Don't we have enough roads already?

Areas without large development or resource extraction are preferred by many (including myself) to recreate in. Keeping environmental and culturally important lands preserved and protected is very important to me and has been an amazing legacy that those in past administrations have left to the current generation.  We should be considering if there are any additional lands that should be well-protected at the Federal level, so they are available without dramatic alterations to future generations instead of changing the status of already-established monuments.\n\nThank you,\n\nJeff Stallman	0	\N	\N	\N
394	DOI-2017-0002-0394	2017-05-12	It is essential to review and put into context the decisions of our leaders - particularly when dealing with public lands in a remote corner of our country. I have lived in southeastern Utah for the extent of my adult life and I believe the richness of our lands are the integrity of their value. \n\nA lot of conversation has gone on these several years and I have had the opportunity to listen in on both sides of the issue. People are adamant, no matter where they are coming from. Sometimes both ways is the only way we will have it. \n\nI have quite a bit to say about the past and the future of this place - but that is a conversation for another time. \n\nWhat matters now is the opportunity we have to support and protect the rights of the people who have lived in this land before us, alongside us, and with us into the future. The Bears Ears National Monument is an opportunity to co-manage these lands with the nation within our nation - that of the Native Peoples of the Four Corners Region. \n\nI wholeheartedly support this endeavor as a determined moral step in improving relations between and within our regional communities, and as a creative venture into new forms of regenerative land management within the federal system of public lands. \n\nWe are stewards of the land - throughout the United States - and we are due for a good and honest example of how to be caring, thoughtful, successful land and resource managers. \n\nLet's set aside the politics, the fear, the insecurity of dashed hopes and lost dreams - and take this opportunity to build something new out of something very old, and - as some will have it - sacred.	0	\N	\N	\N

402	DOI-2017-0002-0402	2017-05-12	Secretary Zinke, \n\nThank you so much for coming to San Juan County and giving us a voice.  I am against the monument.   I believe some of the land needs extra protection, but the 1.39 million acres is to much.  I believe that public land best use is multiple use.  This monument will affect the culture and lifestyles of the people who live in San Juan County.  Many of us depend on the land for many uses, farming, ranching, mining, recreation, herb, pinion and wood gathering.  Many families depend on the wood to heat their homes and cook.  The local people love this land and take care of it.  I know a few residents have participated in looting and vandalism but the majority do all they can to protect it.  The rancher and farmers need the land, they are the true environmentalist.  They know they need to take care of it so it will be a benefit to them.  We in San Juan County choose to live here, we love the lifestyle and culture it provides to raise a family.  A monument is advertised to all the world, inviting millions of people here.  In 2016 Grand Staircase Escalante saw 1400 cases of looting and vandalism while In the past five years San Juan County saw only 25.  With the monument the large area it is, will be impossible to maintain.  Our National Monuments and Parks are being loved to death.   I don't believe a monument this size will offer protection.  My son-in-law came upon some men who tried to drive their BMW up the Mountain road in April.  They became bogged down in snow and mud and almost slid off a cliff.  Rock Climbers came into the area by Cottonwood crossing UTE land, not knowing if they were off of it, made a youtube video of them clearing the cliffs for future climbers.  They were knocking down rocks and boulders that were in the way.  I don't believe this is taking care of the land and protecting it.  If a smaller area is designated as a monument it will be easier to maintain and teach people to be respectful.  the most disturbing thing with this monument was the dishonesty of environmental groups and seeing their agenda pushed on the residents.  When Secretary Jewell  the meeting in Bluff was to have local input.  I arrived earlier in the day.  Bus after Bus came to this small community.   Many of the people were paid with a free trip, free food an a free t-shirt.   Many did not even know why they were there and where the Bears Ears Were located.  I watched a man gather these people around as they got off the bus.  They were told they were to say that they were there to protect the Bears Ears and were to take up seats so the locals could not get in.   It was very saddening to see the dishonesty that went on.   That is why is has been so refreshing to see that you actually seem interested in all sides and views of the people in San Juan County.   Please rescind the monument or reduce the size greatly.  Let the people use the land In many different ways.\n\nThank You, \nLeslie Nielson    	0	\N	\N	\N

404	DOI-2017-0002-0404	2017-05-12	I strongly oppose this review. There is no need to review whether these national monuments are important - the evidence overwhelmingly points in favor of maintaining the reserves as they stand. It could even be beneficial to expand these monuments. These national monuments are deeply important for recreational purposes but essential for ecosystem services such as protecting habitats to sustain biodiversity, maintaining our clean air and water (plants naturally filter pollutants out of the air and add oxygen through photosynthesis!), and protecting vital delicate natural areas that would suffer and die under undue human stress. Particularly when it comes to marine monuments, these reserves give humans countless benefits, some of which are invisible to our eyes but sustain our existence (for peer-reviewed references please see: Worm et al., 2006 "Impacts of biodiversity loss on ocean ecosystem services" in Science; Halpern & Warner, 2002 "Marine reserves have rapid and lasting effects" in Ecology Letters). I also would point you to Righter (1989) "National Monuments to National Parks: The Use of the Antiquities Act of 1906" in Western Historical Quarterly as an example of how these monuments were and still are intended to be used.\n\nI would like to comment specifically on Mt. Katahdin. From the days of Henry David Thoreau (and obviously for hundreds of years prior to Thoreau's existence and writings), this wilderness has held a magical place in the lives of so many Americans. Anyone who has visited the Katahdin wilderness knows that this region is an unique and incomparably beautiful place with vast biodiversity. It also provides essential recreation opportunities for the people of Maine and New England, particularly people in rural areas who cannot afford a fancy vacation beyond car camping in the Katahdin wilderness - access to the highest mountain in Maine, to the ice cold & crystal clear streams and rivers, to the stunningly emerald pine trees and jagged ridge lines are all at risk if this monument is not protected.	3	\N	\N	\N

423	DOI-2017-0002-0423	2017-05-12	I am completely opposed to revoking any protections of our national monuments. The Antiquities Act has been used by our Presidents to preserve and protect some our nation's most important cultural and natural resources for all future generations. The Antiquities Act does NOT make provisions whereby a president may remove prior protections, and our current POTUS would clearly be overstepping his authority by doing so.\n\nCoral reefs are currently dying all across our planet's oceans. I steadfastly oppose removing protections from any and all marine monuments containing reefs. including but not limited to Pacific Remote Islands, Rose Atoll and Northeast Canyons and Seamounts. Removing protections from coral while we are in the midst of a massive die off is madness of the highest caliber. The administration has directly said they want to remove protections so those areas can be exploited for fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are contributing to the destruction of life on earth as we know it through global warming, as confirmed by scientific consensus. Therefor, removing protections from dying marine resources in order to allow increased fossil fuel consumption adds insult (an death) to injury.\n\nI staunchly oppose any removal of protections from my nation's National Monuments containing Native American cultural resources. Bears Ears National Monument, which contains thousands of native artifacts, is a perfect case in point. Tribal elders are rightfully outraged at POTUS' disregard for these important historical relics. I join their outrage. Basin and Range, Berryessa Snow Mountain, Canyons of the Ancients, and Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks also contain precious rock art, ancient dwellings and/or other native artifacts, and must retain protected monument status! I absolutely abhor removing protection from ancient rock art sites. As an artist, I personally attest to the precious merit of ancient rock art in connecting our human race to our ancestors, that this linkage with our earliest image makers is vital, inspiring, spiritual, fueling our sense of who we are as a nation.\n\nSand to Snow contains 12 threatened and endangered species and is one of the most biologically diverse places in California, and must retain protection.\n\nEnough is enough. POTUS should stop acting dictatorial, and respect the presidents who served before. Respect our cultural monument designations!

The United States distinguished itself as a country "for the people" when it set aside places of beauty and nature for the enjoyment of all.  To undermine this fundamental principal in any thinly disguised effort to enrich corporations and the wealthy is an assault on the values of our great democracy.\n\nThe U.S. is already shamefully behind other countries in our development and use of alternative energy and recycling efforts.  As one of the richest nations, we should be setting the example and leading the world toward a sustainable energy  program.\n\nAs an active voter, I strong request that protections for our national monuments and public lands be strengthened.	0	\N	\N	\N

It will cause more restrictions for the local community,  that need the land for cultural use. I am speaking of both native and anglo culture that is alive in this area.  If you allow one culture to use it for their needs but deny the other,  the other cultures will die out.  The natives have been heard,  but the local pioneer heritage culture has not.  They hunt and gather and take care of their cattle and small mines that have been in their families for generations with as much of a cultural heritage as the native population. Both the Native and Anglo cultures should be preserved.  \nThe community needs this land for both of the cultures to survive.  \nIncreased tourism by the monument designation will increase traffic and result in increase of vandalism and looting.  This will only result in an increase of restrictions which will affect the locals ability to use the land. This use of the land enhances the land, and does not degrade or endanger it.  Previous regulations sufficiently protected the land from excessive mining or looting and destruction of Anasazi sites.  \nMonument designation will cause a loss of income from land taxes to fund the local schools. \nPlease reduce or rescind the Bears Ears National Monument. \n	0	\N	\N	\N

Oil or gas mining should not be allowed to permanently destroy a place of such natural beauty and cultural significance. Please don't listen to the politicians in Utah who are looking for short term economic gains from public lands like Bears Ears, and instead preserve them for us all to enjoy and appreciate. Working with brands that make outdoor gear and apparel, I see first-hand the long-term economic benefits that access to public lands provides. \n\nFor more than 100 years, Presidents of both parties have used the Antiquities Act--a tool signed into law by Theodore Roosevelt--to enact far-sighted protections for our common American inheritance. Bears Ears is exactly the kind of place the Antiquities Act intended to protect. It is rich in cultural history which inspired a historic coalition of tribes to band together to push for its designation. In addition to protecting over 100,000 archaeological sites, the designation preserves world-class recreation opportunities in places like Cedar Mesa, Grand Gulch, and Indian Creek.\n\nThe process that led to the designation of Bears Ears National Monument was thorough and transparent. For more than 80 years, decision makers from all sides presented proposals seeking permanent protection of all or part of this incredible landscape. The boundaries were informed by both the multi-year Public Lands Initiative and by a proposal from the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition. Those boundaries do not exceed the acreage necessary to preserve the rich cultural heritage, ecological values, and recreation assets.\n\nThank you for reviewing the decades of hard work and thoughtful consideration that culminated in the designation of Bears Ears National Monument.

442	DOI-2017-0002-0442	2017-05-12	I oppose revoking any of the national monuments listed in this Review. To first establish a NM, careful study is conducted that takes into account positive and negative consequences to the environment and to local communities/stakeholders. These were already determined to be more favorable to the area and the environment/site and that NM status was warranted. Reviewing them now is a violation of tradition that NM are protected in perpetuity and denies the validity of the earlier studies.\n\nI personally know and have worked (as a plant ecologist) in several of the NM included in this Review: Bears Ears, Berryessa Snow Mountain, Carrizo Plain, Cascade Siskiyou, Giant Sequioa, Grand Staircase - Escalante, Mojave Trials, Sand to Snow, and San Gabriel. These areas have unique ecological and geological features that deserve protection or encompass important, large ecosystems that are threatened by fragmentation. As a child, my family's summer trips included the canyon lands of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase. I want my grandchild and all future generations to have the same opportunities to relish these locales without them being despoiled by short-term profits from mining, fossil fuel extraction, ranching or other development. Carrizo Plains is a remnant of the California vegetation that existed here before settlement and the wildflower display this year was visible from space.\n\nWe can't get back any of these NMs once they are dismantled. Not opening them for development, industry, and other exploitation in the first place is the best way to retain all these NMs as part of our American heritage. I absolutely oppose the proposal to revoke NM status or to diminish protection of these lands.	0	\N	\N	\N

I have been to many of these areas and still more are on my list of places to visit.  In a time when our country is being more and more populated and the land is being more and more obliterated, these public lands represent the last vestige of hope that we will indeed have open spaces that belong to everyone and no one.  We will be able to pass these lands to our children, their children, and so on.  If these public lands are taken from the public and given to either local governments or sold to private entities, short term gains may be enjoyed by a select few.  But long term loss will be felt by all.  \n\nI'm advocating that these lands be kept public and protected under state and federal laws and regulations.  I'm advocating that we not only use this review to learn more about the lands listed, but that we consider adding to the list.  Please please please do not put your economic or political self-interests ahead of what is best for our nation as a whole.

444	DOI-2017-0002-0444	2017-05-12	\n       I am opposed to the national monument status for the Bear's Ears proposal for the following reasons;\n1. Much of the area is already public land (BLM administrated) under a multiple-use designation. As a national monument, under the Park Service, use of this public land will be much more restrictive including recreational use which is one of the reasons being given for the N M designation. \n\n2. The Current River here in Missouri, a scenic river administered by the Park Service, is now restricted to the extent that many recreational activities which used to occur such as camping and even swimming are now restricted in various ways. The park service even tried to prohibit a local church (Gladden Valley Baptist Church) from performing baptisms in the Current River, an activity which had a 100+ year precedent. Only after a strong outcry from many Missourians did this get removed. National monument status will most probably result in similar regulatory over-reaching. \n\n3.

My hope is that you'll affirm that these treasured spaces truly are national monuments and should be protected for future generations to enjoy.

450	DOI-2017-0002-0450	2017-05-12	Dear Secretary Zinke,\n\nThe national monuments under review were designated after extensive local input and review, and I appreciate that you are providing similar opportunity for comment here. Please also consider public listening sessions in the effected areas before making any final determinations.\n\nGenerally, the national monuments under review have provided numerous benefits to the surrounding communities, including economic benefits associated with outdoor recreation, travel and tourism. I have personally visited six of these monuments since their designation, and cherish my time spent there with friends and family. Those I have not yet visited I hope too in the coming years, and some day with my children.\n\nProtection of America's public lands, including the national monuments under review, are critical to supporting 7.6 million American jobs that drive an $887 billion outdoor recreation economy. I am proud to be one of the individuals who works in that industry, as I have my entire adult life. When considering multiple uses, outdoor recreation - and the economic activity it brings - should be considered. \n\nBefore making any recommendations altering existing National Monuments it would seem necessary to review all documentation that was originally considered about the scientific and cultural values of the place. While I do not personally have that information, I trust you will take the time to consult with tribes, scientists, conservation interests, local stakeholders and others who know these places well. \n\nThank you for taking the time to review my comments.	0	\N	\N	\N

454	DOI-2017-0002-0454	2017-05-12	I would like to state my support for maintaining the area of all current National Monuments as they are currently defined, and not revoking their protected status as National Monuments. I would like to make my support for the Bears Ears monument especially well known, as it seems to have drawn the ire of national figures who wish to see portions of it turned over to developers, in spite of the fact that Bears Ears enjoys the support of a majority of the citizens of Utah. I live in Salt Lake City, and support among this city's residents is almost unanimous. I must also state my concern that once again the opinions of native tribal authorities are at risk of being disregarded. Our nation's sad history of allocating Native American lands and heritage cannot simply be ignored. The tribes have spearheaded this initiative, culminating in the protection of Bears Ears as a National Monument, and to revoke its status would be yet another occasion where the US Government asserted its authority over indigenous people the the benefit of an extremely fortunate few. \n\nBut my concerns go far beyond the people who support these monuments. The land is, itself, a national treasure. America is one of the only industrialized nations which still enjoys vast wilderness where the human spirit can, for a moment, be free to stand under the same skies as our ancestors. To defile that land with oil derricks, mines, tailing ponds and coal roads is an unfathomable robbery of our posterity. Our children's children will live in a world very different than ours. Will they look back on the choices we make today and say "National Monuments were a waste of productive land. That land should have been harvested for resources"? I cannot fathom that they would. We look back on the designation of America's first preserved lands; Yosemite, Yellowstone, the Grand Canyon, and we give thanks to the people who saw that those places needed saving, so that we could witness with our eyes what those people saw. I hope that is the course we will continue to set. To protect what is beautiful and wild today, so that that it can remain that way for eternity. 	0	\N	\N	\N
455	DOI-2017-0002-0455	2017-05-12	Bears Ears National Monument must be protected.  For years, Tribal Nations with ancestral and spiritual ties to the 1.35 million acres that make up Bears Ears have fought to protect these lands. The value of Bears Ears lies in its long history as a sacred place for the Navajo, Hopi, Ute Mountain Ute, Ute Indian, and Pueblo of Zuni.  Bears Ears is vital to tribal communities across the Colorado Plateau as a place of subsistence, spirituality, and healing. These lands are home to tens of thousands of important cultural sites, including the cliff dwellings, villages, and rock art panels of the Ancestral Puebloan people. This magnificent landscape, rich in biodiversity and of critical importance to the Colorado River Basin upon which 40 million people rely, must remain pristine and accessible for generations to come.

These lands have been deemed of particular natural or cultural value that transcends any use they might have for extractive resources of any kind.  The Carrizo Plain, for instance, is one of the rare places where there are still extensive stands of native California grasses and wildflowers.  This year there was a superbloom that attracted a record number of visitors. Not only did (and do) these visitors contribute to the local economies, they are treated to a piece of their natural history.

458	DOI-2017-0002-0458	2017-05-12	I would like to urge Secretary Zinke not to make any changes to established national monuments. There is so little land that is NOT already under development, or being used for resource extraction already. And I know when you look at the American West, it is easy to think the opposite is true. But think of it more this way: the American West is all that remains of wilderness. The entire United States used to be that way. It's not an environmentalist thing or part of a liberal agenda. This is a bipartisan point of view. Nobody wants America's beautiful backcountry turned into smokestacks and oil rigs. Especially somewhere as special as Bears Ears or Escalante - some of the most unique land I've seen anywhere in the world. It's just too emotionally charged, and for what? A dying industry? The outdoor industry creates three times as many jobs as the fossil fuels industry. We all know that sacrificing the outdoor recreation potential in Bears Ears, Escalante, or most of these other national monuments in exchange for resource extraction is a losing investment in the long run... not even in a very long run at all. And, of course, speaking of Bears Ears specifically, do we really want to hit Native Americans with just another in a seemingly endless procession of slaps to the face? For the first time, native peoples were consulted and central to the planning of a national monument. That's a step forwards toward reparations for past atrocities, and respect for native peoples. Do we really want to simply undo that giant step in the right direction for the sole purpose of putting more money in the pockets of the Koch brothers? The writing is on the wall. More and more, the word is getting out, and people see through the ruse. The motives behind this are transparent, and unacceptable. You know it, I know it, everyone knows it. And of course, the lens of history is more transparent still. Think about your legacy. Think of what you will be known for 50 years down the road. Think of your children, and their children, and how they will want to remember the Zinke name. \n\nThink about what it might mean to set this precedent of rescinding or restructuring national monuments (something no previous president has ever done, from either party). Think about what we stand to gain by doing so. And then, think about what we stand to lose.	0	\N	\N	\N

Farmers and ranchers needs should not be place over the desires of the entire population of the United States and our wishes as federal taxpayers. We set aside these lands and animals years ago for the enjoyment and enrichment of future generations. It would be an atrocity to let greed and profit to take away what took decades to protect.   I think if most Americans were polled they would rather have Wild Horses, Burros, and other wild animals along with open spaces and protected United States lands instead of building more bombs or planes.

This precedent should stay intact. Furthermore, the revenue that these monuments generate as tourist attractions will far exceed the short terms gains that could otherwise be generated through extraction-related industries.

483	DOI-2017-0002-0483	2017-05-12	I have several comments:\n1) In general, designation a parcel of land will increase certain types of activity as many Americans want to visit National Parks and Monuments.\n2) Many of these National Monuments take away freedoms of Americans. For example, people with disabilties cannot use a motorized means to get around. \n3) The monuments bring more restrictions on recreational activities. Yet, they increase in many cases visitation\n4) The BLM, USFS, and NPS are already understaffed and under funded. This will not change. So rules cannot be enforced, and facilities not improved. This actually encourages (in some instances) disobedience\n5) It takes away rights and property of some state lands - either by restriction of movement or by land swaps. Grazing rights?  What will happen to this land.\n6) I personally do not think that the Native Americans can have much say in these lands -they belong to all Americans. Many of our ancestors crossed thru these paths. These lands are not on reservation lands.\n7) National Monuments limit the use of these lands for resources. By resources I do not mean just oil/gas and mining. This also means no solar, no wind, no transmission lines for renewable energy.\n8) I have seen too much of the land-grabbing by the federal government in the west. In general the people in Washington, DC and other eastern areas do not understand the west. This is our land. This is where some of our forefathers homesteaded. This land should be used by the people, not restricted. I am for recreation - people getting outside - all people whether disabled or not, hiking or dirtbiking, hunters, anglers. Ranchers need land. This has and can all be done responsibly.  \n9) Turning something into a National Monument does not stop vandalism of artifacts. There will be no more enforcement. In many cases, restriction creates more damage. Remember, the funds are not there to enforce the rules and boundaries of the numerous National Monuments and Wilderness Areas that have been created in recent years.\n10) I hope that all people that comment have been to the west and have a full grasp of what all Americans do for recreation, and what the fiscal complications are of creating more federal monuments.\n	0	\N	\N	\N

489	DOI-2017-0002-0489	2017-05-12	I would like to show my support for ALL national monuments, but specifically for Katahdin Woods and Waterways, Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante.  Being a native Mainer, I have enjoyed the woods of northern Maine my whole life.  I was elated to hear that there would be more access to those woods once Katahdin Woods and Waterways was announced.  Previously being privately owned land, I do not understand why the reduction or undoing of this national monument is being considered.  To use a term that has been thrown around lately, this land was "locked up" before it was declared a national monument.\n\nAlthough from Maine, I have spent the last three years in Utah.  I have taken numerous trips to explore southern Utah, and because of this, I am also strongly in favor of both Utah national monuments, Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante, remaining untouched.  Bears Ears protects a large portion of tribal lands for numerous Native American tribes in the four corners region.  It also assures the protection of incredible hikes, canyons, and world class rock climbing.  Grand Staircase is home to a plethora of beautiful slot canyons, waterfalls, and rock formations.  Along with this, visitors can enjoy mountain biking, hiking, and canyoneering.  With our nation's incredible advancements in technology and infastructure, why can't we save some areas to step back, slow down, and enjoy what has existed for long before we set foot in it.  These areas, with their incredible,vast, scenery, deserve to be protected for generations to enjoy for what they are, not what we can turn them into.	0	\N	\N	\N

846	DOI-2017-0002-0846	2017-05-12	To the Department of the Interior,\n\nDependent on this public review, the Grand Canyon surrounding region could lose significant protections for sensitive habitats and cultural sites. Papahanaumokuakea and other important marine national monuments could also be negatively affected. Within 2 years, The Grand Canyon National Park and Papahanaumokuakea (both UNESCO sites of Outstanding Universal Value) could be placed on the In Danger List. If one of these properties was placed on the In Danger List, the consequences  economically and in regards to public opinion, would be severe.\n\nOf the 27 National Monuments "under review", four of these national monuments surround the Grand Canyon National Park. The Grand Canyon is one of the most important National Parks in the United States (in terms of geology and cultural heritage), to put in jeopardy lands surrounding and adjacent to the Grand Canyon is irresponsible and dangerous. \n\nBear Ears National Monument is almost universally supported by surrounding tribes and outdoor enthusiasts. To take land from Native American tribes, who were integral in the creation of this monument, would be a painful reminder that the US Government has nearly always been and continues to be dishonest in their relations with Tribal governments. The Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition met with Secratary Zinke recently, therefore the DOI already knows the support the monument has amongst the Native population.\n\nKatahadin Woods and Waters is already showing promise in visitors to the region, real estate, and local business. The land that makes this monument is a free gift to the people of Maine, and not one tax dollar will be used (40 million in private endowments are available). The monument gets more popular by the day, and access is available to all. Promises in regards to hunting and snowmobiling access have been kept.\n\nI have personally visited several of these incredible national monuments. Basin and Range in Nevada, a tremendous natural wonder in the heart of the Great Basin. Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks in New Mexico, which has been a major boost in economic activity in Las Cruces, popular with locals and visitors alike. All six National Monuments "under review" in California are stunning and much loved, even celebrated. Support in all 6 cases is strong at the local and state level. Meetings were open and public, and the small minority of opponents were given a voice and a seat at the table to share their concerns. Most of these opponents have now become ardent supporters.\n\nConsider the reasons being given for Rescinding National Monuments?\n1) Not enough public input\n2) Limiting recreation and access\n2) Mining, grazing, (America First Energy Policy)\n\nThe Antiquities Act does not require Public input, but use of the act has evolved. Under Obama, every designation was proceeded by public engagement and comment both at the local and state level. Evidence supports that the 27 monuments "under review" have become more open to recreation, not less. Even hunting, ATV use have been maintained in several of these national monuments when local public opinion brought this concern to bear. \n\nI implore the Department of the Interior and the public to join me in demanding these lands be preserved for perpetuity. Short-sited exploitation of resources for temporary profits will harm all parties, only the very few who would line their pockets would profit. \n\nBest Regards,\nKyle Magnuson (Educator, History Teacher)	4	\N	\N	\N

Places like the Grand Canyon, the Sonoran Desert, the Vermillion Cliffs, Ironwood Forest in Arizona provide an opportunity for people to spend time in the natural world, and they're an enormous draw for tourists visiting the state. Similarly, monuments like the San Gabriel Mountains in California and Escalante in Utah are places that me and my family make plans to visit, which often brings us to parts of the country we might not otherwise have seen. This provides an essential link between the people living all across our great and varied nation - as well as a link between all generations of Americans, present, past, and future. What will we tell our grandchildren when they ask why we allowed the Grand Canyon - one of the seven wonders of the world! - to be destroyed in a short-sighted bid for oil or development? Losing these national monuments would lessen the spirit of the nation, and would diminish travel and exploration around each and every one of them (the spiritual loss may be incalculable, but the loss of tourist money in these communities is very calculable indeed). \n\nPlease protect our vital national resources - the beauty of these monuments is irreplaceable, which is why they've been designated for protection.

As a National Monument it will not further protect it as the environmentalists believe, but just bring more people, litter, vandalism, looting etc. We are local, we don't want this.

This declaration upset the political leadership in Utah because they are owned by oil and gas companies such as CITLA.\n\nFurthermore, the affront to tribal sovereignty in the State of Utah has been despicable. The political leadership in Utah has consistently ignored tribal leadership, and Secretary Zinke only gave them an hour of his time.\n\nThere is a clear agenda here and it's not for the people. 	0	\N	\N	\N

499	DOI-2017-0002-0499	2017-05-12	I recently visited Bears Ears National Monument and saw firsthand how incredibly special this place is.  It is surprising and sickening that after visiting it, Sec. Zinke would still consider recommending this monument be rescinded or having the boundaries redrawn.  The Bears Ears National Monument was created after extensive public input and the boundaries were drawn very deliberately - with the ecological and historical areas in mind.  Furthermore, the communities around these monuments end up benefiting from the jobs that are created. Protecting public lands is a win for the planet and for the economy.

500	DOI-2017-0002-0500	2017-05-12	Dear Secretary Zinke,\n\nAs you and your staff at the Department of Interior consider what recommendations you will make to President Trump regarding national monuments designated since 1996, please give considerable attention to the fact that monument designations are proven economic drivers for the local communities and surrounding region. \n\nMany of the local economies surrounding national monuments have successfully transitioned to a more diverse, and therefore more resilient economy, that puts outdoor recreation, travel and tourism on equal footing with ranching, mining, energy development and other uses of our nation's public lands. \n\nI believe that any degradation of existing monuments threatens not only these local economies, but the 7.6 million American jobs that drive $887 billion in annual consumer spending, the power behind the outdoor recreation economy.	0	\N	\N	\N
501	DOI-2017-0002-0501	2017-05-12	It is in my opinion that Basin and Range, Bears Ears, Berryessa Snow Mountain, Canyons of the Ancients, Carrizo Plain, Cascade Siskiyou, Craters of the Moon, Giant Sequoia, Gold Butte, Grand Canyon-Parashant, Grand Staircase-Escalante, Hanford Reach, Ironwood Forest Mojave Trails, Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks, Rio Grande del Norte, Sand to Snow, San Gabriel Mountains, Sonoran Desert, Upper Missouri River Breaks, and Vermilion Cliffs, conform to section 1 of The Executive Order 13792 as every monument designation reflects The Antiquities Act's "requirements and original objectives" and "appropriately balance the protection of landmarks, structures, and objects against the appropriate use of Federal lands and the effects on surrounding lands and communities."\n\nTherefore, it is imperative that all national monuments being reviewed pursuant to criteria in executive order 13792 remain protected as each was originally given adequate public outreach and coordination with relevant stakeholders before designation.\n\nIn regards to the requisite determination factors the Secretary is to consider, I would like to voice my support that all of the monuments listed meet:\nCriteria (i), none exceed "the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected."\n\nCriteria (ii), all monuments are appropriately classified under the Act as "historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, [or] other objects of historic or scientific interest."\n\nCriteria (vi), there is currently the availability of Federal resources to properly manage designated areas.\n\nIn reference to criteria (vii), it is important to understand that no president has ever moved to rescind a designation made by a previous president. This precedent should stay intact. Furthermore, the revenue that these monuments generate as tourist attractions will far exceed the short terms gains that could otherwise be generated through extraction-related industries. Finally, these monuments are national treasures, to rescind any sort of protections for the implied intent of private use and development is nothing short of treason.	0	\N	\N	\N

Indeed, these National Monuments serve the public in the manner that they are currently managed better than any development of these lands could possibly offer in that they are a natural resource, meaning the public use is to redeem nature on them.  \n\nWe believe they are appropriately classified based on personal visits to these lands.\n\nWe have reviewed all of these lands & find that all of them are properly designated as National Monuments and this designation should nat change.  Nor should the boundaries be shrunk in any manner that would change the manner by which they are managed.  \n\nHowever in relation to the management of these lands, we feel that properties within or adjacent to these lands can be adequately managed by local public decision, and with consideration of the remote, wild or natural aspects of these lands, Federal Management Policies specifically of the bordering areas must yield to Local and Customary Usage.\n\n\n\n	0	\N	\N	\N

512	DOI-2017-0002-0512	2017-05-12	I strongly oppose the de-designation of ANY National Monument, or any part of them.  These Monuments are not random choices, but the culmination of a long process by environmentalists and sportsmen and scientists.  Many in the past have become National Parks, a very good indication of the calibre of the lands so selected.  I have visited and camped in many of these places and I love them.  They are part of the natural heritage of all Americans, not places to be sold or industrialized.  It has been my general observation over the past 40 or more years that the local people around these monuments or parks initially oppose them, but when they discover the benefits they become ardent supporters.  Witness the tourist, outfitter, hunting businesses that have sprung up around these places, business that the Federal government rarely competes with.\n\nSome things are just too sacred to wreck for profit or for the supposed jobs that may result.\n	0	\N	\N	\N
513	DOI-2017-0002-0513	2017-05-12	Giustina Resources manages third-generation family-owned timberland in western Oregon. Our lands border lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management in many places. Forest fuel load conditions and road access conditions throughout the neighboring BLM lands is a concern to us as those conditions may increase the risk of loss to our assets and the cost to protect them.  This concern impacts all private forest owners in Oregon as we all share in the cost of large fire suppression on private forest lands and west-side BLM lands (BLM lands protected under contract with the Oregon Department of Forestry). BLM lands comprise 22% of the acres protected by ODF, but account for 56% of the acres burned by large fires and 59% of the large fire costs ("large fires" are those that grow beyond local district control capacity). Fuel conditions and vehicle access are key contributors to these results.  \n\nThis background on the fire relationship is key to our concerns related to the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument. Just prior to the 2017 expansion of this monument from 85,000 acres to 137,500 acres, the BLM had been contemplating the decommissioning of up to 165 miles of roads within the monument boundary to further monument goals. We are very concerned that the reduced access for fire suppression efforts and increased fuel loads resulting from reduced active management would increase the risk of loss to neighboring private assets and increase fire suppression costs for all private forest landowners in the state as a result of the cost-sharing described above.\n\nWe do not support the recent expansion of the Cascade-Siskiyou Monument and would like the Department to reconsider the designation of this monument in light of the fire risks and costs outlined above.  We also encourage the Department to give the concerns of neighboring landowners and the local Fire Protection Associations considerable weight in evaluating any future monument designations.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to comment	0	\N	\N	\N

515	DOI-2017-0002-0515	2017-05-12	I understand that Bears Ears is a controversial monument from an American economic perspective. A private oil company managed to gain access to some of the land before Obama declared it a National Monument, and now that business venture is blocked. Secretary Zinke, I understand at times that a politician is under pressure from many different parties to make a decision in their favor. I can understand the oil company's frustration over "their" land being taken from them by the feds-land that contains some of the oldest, untouched archeological evidence of mankind on Earth---but when you weigh economic frustration--the frustration of not being able to sell a replaceable product--to a precious, irreplaceable piece of land that will never ever be the same again I think the results are clear. In a time when human beings have spread to every corner of the earth we need to protect our history, our land, our environment. There is enough industry, enough oil, enough people, enough machinery. We don't need anymore of that. What we DO need more of is these irreplaceable elements of our world--unpopulated land, untainted land--that we are losing on a daily basis to the constant barrage of business and industry.  I believe it is my duty as an American citizen to actively support the heritage and beauty of our land over private business. This was never meant to belong to the oil industry. Have you seen a sunset in this beautiful desert? Have you ever been to an ancient archeological site that is 20,000 years old on this land? It is worth more than oil. And we need to start showing our President that we as a people will not tolerate our industry's ignorance of what their consumers actually care for: this country. Let us inspire innovation and specialization over replication and expansion. Keep our National Monuments protected, and keep our oil industry under scrutiny! 	0	\N	\N	\N

Although I believe the Antiquities Act may not be the proper channel to protect our nation's spectacular lands, I feel it is the only way in some cases such as this. I have very little faith that federal or state government entities are capable of carrying out the wishes of Americans (even when in majority) to protect such lands. I feel they ignore protection in order to bow to short-term industry and corporate desires, whether grazing, mining, or energy extraction.

The people of the county and people who have visited over the years have taken very good care of  the Bears Ears and all the land included in the over-reaching monument designation.\n\nThe monument designation will only bring many people to the area who have no connection to it and will not have respect for it. For example, when Sally Jewell visited the monument and when she and her party left, they left garbage and a mess behind which is totally unacceptable and disrespectful.

525	DOI-2017-0002-0525	2017-05-12	Since I first drove from Colorado to national monuments in Utah in the late 1990s, areas that now include the Grand Staircase-Escalante, Bears Ears, and Canyons of the Ancients have become the most important places to me to know that they remain undeveloped and available for others to enjoy their unspoiled vistas and archeologic wonders.  Even with their current status, these areas continue to endure looting, off-road vehicle damage, and destruction of cultural heritage treasures so I would ask you to dedicate MORE resources to their protection.  The Antiquities Act was created exactly for these places - to try to save our collective heritage and native peoples' sacred places for the history and wisdom they teach us and to leave for future generations to observe in their natural surroundings.  I still hope to one day paddle the Upper Missouri River Breaks, the route that Lewis and Clark took in their Corps of Discovery, and for DOI to even consider removing protection to open it up to oil and gas exploration or mining or other short-sighted development is a shame too deep to discuss.  Arizona's Sonoran Desert is probably the most unique habitat with the least amount of unspoiled acreage remaining in the U.S. - any consideration of reduced protections is also a travesty and misuse of government power.  Just this past month I witnessed a massive die-off of three species of sea birds on our local coasts and every year something else adversely affects the oceans - those national monuments also need to remain in place.  It has been shown that protected ocean areas provide additional fish and other species to replenish adjacent non-protected waters.  Please use your position to protect the resources the American public has entrusted to you.  You are beholden to us and not to the development companies pushing for these monument reductions.  	0	\N	\N	\N
526	DOI-2017-0002-0526	2017-05-12	Dear Secretary Zinke,\n\nOf all the obvious reasons as to why all 27 National Monuments under review should continue as such, I'll lay out the bare-bones facts from Joe-Smoe's perspective.\n\nAs the last 21 years has proven, the federal government (an extension of US citizens) can function properly with the current National Monuments' designation. Therefore, a magical review is not, and can not, be the catalyst that manifests conflict with the multi-use land policy. Remember, the multi-use land policy is practiced daily - outdoor enthusiasts and tourists alike flock to these national monuments for varied reasons: sport, experience, camaraderie, spirituality, and religion. Multi-use indeed.\n\nRecent numbers on the outdoor industry's financial impact in the United States is staggering. It turns out that we the people enjoy outdoor recreation more than our vehicles even. The 27 National Monuments under review attract tens of thousands of visitors every year. Those visitors set out into these protected areas with gear and supplies, both of which cost money. That spending provides jobs, incomes, and ultimately leads to the federal government's favorite treat - taxes! Millions of dollars of economical impact are derived solely from the 27 national monuments under review. Following that logic, losing national monuments translates to people losing jobs, people spending less, and the federal government receiving less tax money.\n\nMANY of the national monuments under review contain sacred areas. Areas that are not only sacred, but have religious value to US citizens. In regards to tribal groups, their fiscal health and religious health are tied together. If the federal government chooses to disregard religious ground, as was done with the DAP, it also chooses to disregard fiscal and ethical grounds. Economic development is not associated with religion, in fact it is separate from religion. Religion, and any fiscal means that stem from it, does not embody economy. Religious grounds and places are for the tribal groups to govern and maintain - if that be through economic methods than it is at the tribe's discretion, as religion is not part of the federal governments responsibility.\n\nWhen its all laid out, the right thing to do is easy to see. Ethics isn't difficult, its the outside influences that twist perspective that makes ethics seem difficult. The future, objective reader of this story will easily make out the ethical 'right'. Can you remove yourself from the whispers to allow sound logic and intellect to guide you? Time will tell...	0	\N	\N	\N

533	DOI-2017-0002-0533	2017-05-12	We must protect Bears Ears National Monument.\n\nFor years, Tribal Nations have fought to protect their lands, only to have them repeatedly desecrated and taken away. The value of Bears Ears lies in its long history as a sacred place for the Navajo, Hopi, Ute Mountain Ute, Ute Indian, and Pueblo of Zuni, who have ancestral and spiritual ties to these 1.35 million acres.\n\nBears Ears is vital to tribal communities across the Colorado Plateau as a place of subsistence, spirituality, and healing. These lands are home to tens of thousands of important cultural sites, including the cliff dwellings, villages, and rock art panels of the Ancestral Puebloan people. This magnificent landscape, rich in biodiversity and of critical importance to the Colorado River Basin upon which 40 million people rely, must remain pristine and accessible for generations to come.\n\nThe Department of the Interior's review of Bears Ears sets a dangerous precedence and undermines the rights of these Tribal Nations. On your first day as Secretary of the Interior, you said you would "do everything in my power to ensure respect to the sovereign Indian Nations and territories." Please do so. Please follow in the spirit of Theodore Roosevelt and stand with Bears Ears.	0	\N	\N	\N

535	DOI-2017-0002-0535	2017-05-12	The Bears Ears National Monument was properly created under the Antiquities Act after extensive public notice, meetings and input and was done to protect substantial archaeological and cultural resources that have been looted and vandalized principally by local residents for many years.  This is precisely what the Antiquities Act was intended to protect against.  Legal and factual arguments to the contrary are misleading and wholly without basis, for the reasons discussed in greater detail in the blog on this topic prepared for the American College Of Environmental Lawyers titled "Bears Ears Monument Was the Right Decision at the Right Time", available on-line at:\nhttp://www.acoel.org/post/2017/01/24/Bears-Ears-Monument-Designation-Was-the-Right-Decision-at-the-Right-Time.aspx\n\nAttempting to undo or decrease the original Monument creation would be inappropriate and unlawful. Please follow the process outlined in the Proclamation creating this Monument to adopt reasonable rules and Management Plan for operating the Monument, rather than engage in politicking over whether the U.S. should turn over control of these federal lands to state and local government officials, who have declined to control and, in some instances, have participated in the looting of archaeological resources from this area.  Thank you for your careful consideration of this site and surrounding circumstances.  Z. Miller	0	\N	\N	\N
536	DOI-2017-0002-0536	2017-05-12	I am writing to express my strong opposition to removing the National Monument designation for any of the national monuments listed. \n\nConservation is an enduring principle, and preserving the pristine nature of such public lands is an important legacy to leave to future generations. Public lands like these monuments enjoy broad public support both locally and nationally, and even citizens who did not initially favor monument status how do so by an overwhelming margin. Finally, the questionable legality and costs of such an effort suggest this is an ill-conceived idea. Specifically, many legal scholars seem to agree that Presidents cannot rescind or undo designations by previous Presidents without an act of Congress \n\nIn closing, I cite with the words uttered by President Theodore Roosevelt over 100 years. They are just as relevant if not more so today.\n" I believe that the natural resources must be used for the benefit of all our people, and not monopolized for the benefit of the few, and here again is another case in which I am accused of taking a revolutionary attitude. People forget now that one hundred years ago there were public men of good character who advocated the nation selling its public lands in great quantities, so that the nation could get the most money out of it, and giving it to the men who could cultivate it for their own uses. We took the proper democratic ground that the land should be granted in small sections to the men who were actually to till it and live on it. Now, with the water power, with the forests, with the mines, we are brought face to face with the fact that there are many people who will go with us in conserving the resources only if they are to be allowed to exploit them for their benefit. That is one of the fundamental reasons why the special interests should be driven out of politics. Of all the questions which can come before this nation, short of the actual preservation of its existence in a great war, there is none which compares in importance with the great central task of leaving this land even a better land for our descendants than it is for us, and training them into a better race to inhabit the land and pass it on. Conservation is a great moral issue, for it involves the patriotic duty of insuring the safety and continuance of the nation. Let me add that the health and vitality of our people are at least as well worth conserving as their forests, waters, lands, and minerals, and in this great work the national government must bear a most important part."	0	\N	\N	\N
537	DOI-2017-0002-0537	2017-05-12	I would like to urge Secretary Zinke not to make any changes to established national monuments. There is so little land that is NOT already under development, or being used for resource extraction already. And I know when you look at the American West, it is easy to think the opposite is true. But think of it more this way: the American West is all that remains of wilderness. The entire United States used to be that way. It's not an environmentalist thing or part of a liberal agenda. This is a bipartisan point of view. Nobody wants America's beautiful backcountry turned into smokestacks and oil rigs. Especially somewhere as special as Bears Ears or Escalante - some of the most unique land I've seen anywhere in the world. It's just too emotionally charged, and for what? A dying industry? The outdoor industry creates three times as many jobs as the fossil fuels industry. We all know that sacrificing the outdoor recreation potential in Bears Ears, Escalante, or most of these other national monuments in exchange for resource extraction is a losing investment in the long run... not even in a very long run at all. And, of course, speaking of Bears Ears specifically, do we really want to hit Native Americans with just another in a seemingly endless procession of slaps to the face? For the first time, native peoples were consulted and central to the planning of a national monument. That's a step forwards toward reparations for past atrocities, and respect for native peoples. Do we really want to simply undo that giant step in the right direction for the sole purpose of putting more money in the pockets of the Koch brothers? The writing is on the wall. More and more, the word is getting out, and people see through the ruse. The motives behind this are transparent, and unacceptable. You know it, I know it, everyone knows it. And of course, the lens of history is more transparent still. Think about your legacy. Think of what you will be known for 50 years down the road. Think of your children, and their children, and how they will want to remember the Zinke name.\nThink about what it might mean to set this precedent of rescinding or restructuring national monuments (something no previous president has ever done, from either party). Think about what we stand to gain by doing so. And then, think about what we stand to lose.	0	\N	\N	\N

539	DOI-2017-0002-0539	2017-05-12	The importance of open space must supersede the needs of the few.  We must keep in mind that all government actions are due to the voice of an interested party, not just politicians.  There are few decisions that are not made because of a strong lobby.  And there will always be voices of dissent.  When it comes to the preservation of land masses, we must act on the unseen with a belief that all will be affected in a positive way.\nLands such as those associated with Katahdin Woods and Waters bring together the dreams of  citizen landowners with the State to create a greater whole.

This precedent should stay intact. Furthermore, the revenue that these monuments generate as tourist attractions will far exceed the short term \ngains that could otherwise be generated through extraction-related industries.

574	DOI-2017-0002-0574	2017-05-12	I am a law professor who has researched and written on the legal history of public lands.\n\nTo the extent the executive order contemplates eliminating the designation for any previous national monument, in my expert opinion, it exceeds the executive branch's authority under Article II of the Constitution.  The federal government's authority over public land derives from Article IV of the Constitution, which grants Congress, not the President or executive branch, the power to "make all needful Rules and Regulations . . . respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States."  U.S. Const. Art. IV, sect. 3, cl. 2.  The Antiquities Act, 54 U.S.C. sect. 320301, delegates some of that constitutional authority to the President by granting him the power to "declare" federally owned land as a national monument.  The plain text of the provision is unambiguous: Congress has granted the President only the authority to delegate national monuments, not to eliminate them.  Past practice, as well as plain statutory meaning, supports this conclusion.  In 1938, U.S. Attorney General Cummings concluded that the President could not abolish a national monument established under the Antiquities Act.  39 Op. Att'y Gen. 185 (1938).  Attorney General Cummings noted that this approach was consistent with long-standing legal precedent with respect to reservations from the public domain, which the President lacked the authority to alter.  Cummings cited with approval similar conclusions by previous Attorneys General, including an 1862 opinion concluding that the "grant of power to execute a trust, even discretionally, by no means implies the further power to undo it."  Id. at 187 (quoting 10 Op. Att'y Gen. 359, 364 (1862)).\n\nCongress, of course, retains its plenary power over federal lands, and could alter the national monument designations if it so chose.  But any attempt by the executive to do so is ultra vires and would be unlikely to withstand legal challenge.	0	\N	\N	\N
575	DOI-2017-0002-0575	2017-05-12	Please note the intense public review process for these monument designations and the overwhelming majority of American voters who support National Monuments, with few exceptions typically found in the backyard of the Monument state. It is critical that our neighbor's monuments are protected though they may not be our own because a dangerous precedent may be set. In particular, the Utah delegation is incredibly misinformed about development and extractive potential, and have pumped up Utah as ground zero for federal lands transfers to the states. It is an emotional and philosophical debate that mistreats public opinion in the United States. Please enjoy our National Monuments and protect them as they stand.\n\nRyan Mykita	0	\N	\N	\N

The Bears Ears NM is a particularly special place with significance to the human race and all people past, present, and future.

These lands and the artifacts protected within these boundaries are sacred to all human kind and provide a valuable link to the past.

Secretary Zinke has not given adequate time to both sides of the discussion and has instead spent most of his time in Utah visiting with anti-monument Republicans. He did not give equal time to meeting with Native Americans, nor did he meet at all with the Boulder-Escalante Chamber of Commerce. These monuments have well-documented economic benefits which anti-monument arguments conveniently ignore or reject. The monuments were created with careful planning and after other attempts were unsuccessful, not rammed through as other arguments claim. I have grown up scrambling up mountains in the Basin and Range National Monument and wading in Calf's Creek in Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument: these areas must have protections so that not only my children but everyone who wishes can experience the same wonder from the beauty of American lands. Do not remove any existing protections that these national monuments have.\n\nTruthfully though, my arguments are not the reason you should keep all existing monuments intact. The reason you should keep all existing monuments is because Native Americans--like the Navajo, Hopi, Zuni, Ute Mountain Ute, and Uintah Ouray Ute--have requested these protections due to the sacred and historic nature of the area, as well as the many artifacts which remain there and are at risk.

While I will admit I don't have much knowledge about any of these areas, I would like to point out that I oppose any designations that will restrict their recreational use.  I am an avid fan of motorized off-road travel, whether it's in a Jeep, on a motorcycle, ATV, snowmobile, you name it.  I firmly believe that the vast majority of people who share my love of this hobby are the Good Apples that take care of the land, and that it's only a handful of Bad Apples that end up spoiling it.  I know the "other side" will cite this as one of their reasons for wanting to lock up public land, but really, all we need is better policing of ourselves.\n\nFurthermore, by allowing mixed use of public lands, it benefits the local communities greatly.  People will spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars a year making trips to these places to explore and have fun.  They will get hotel rooms, eat at local restaurants, make purchases from many local businesses, etc.\n\nIn your review, please pay special attention to areas with lots of roads and trails that can be used by motorized users, as well as hikers, equestrians, mountain bikers, etc.  Closing down the land will only cause these roads to eventually deteriorate and disappear forever.  Our public land is for EVERYBODY to enjoy, not just the few who want it all to themselves.  Thank you for your time.	0	\N	\N	\N

I have grown up in Blanding and most of my life was spent on the Bears Ears, Elk and Blue Mountain either chasing cows, having picnics, camping or just out driving enjoying the scenery and the new life that comes each spring to the mountains in form of trees and meadows greening and new animals. In the fall I would gather pine nuts with my family and get wood for fuel to heat our house. My family is one of the original Mormon settlers to Blanding and have ranched, farmed or harvested wood all our lives from the these mountain ranges. The local people have maintained the welfare of the mountains for generations and we have done a dang good job. Now that it is a monument it has seen more destruction in the last year than in my entire thirty-five years of being alive and enjoying it. Most of those who want the monument don't even know where the Bears Ears are without being shown and don't live and depend on what they provide. They don't count on the rain that runs down the canyons to fill the reservoirs for the towns drinking and irrigating water. They don't count on the wood that it provides to heat their homes and they don't have the ties that we do with the land. Several ranchers will lose all their cattle as that is their grazing land and in turn the nearby towns will lose a ton of meat that these ranchers provide, not to mention the jobs and heritages that will be lost. The mass majority for the monument don't even live in the state of Utah. Please rescind the monument and let the locals do what we have done for over one hundred years, maintaining the mountain. We have several government bodies that already have rules and regulations in place to help preserve this great land and nobody loves this area more than those that live here. Please allow the ranchers to do what they do best and keep feeding the towns with the beef that is grazed on that beautiful land. Let us keep the fire danger down by harvesting the wood that so many lives depend on to keep warm in the winter. Let the natives continue to do their rituals and beliefs there that are currently no longer allowed. Please give us our land back and let those who know and love it most continue to take care of it. God gave us the land to provide for our needs and we should be allowed to do just that as generations in the past have done and still rely on today. 	0	\N	\N	\N
607	DOI-2017-0002-0607	2017-05-12	It is unfathomable to me that the government would even think about taking away the protected status of any of our national monuments, parks, seashores, forests, etc or even reducing the square mileage of any of them.  Each one is so unique in its own beauty in terms of geography, terrain, animal species, flora, history and sometimes archeological relics.  As our country and planet grows in its human population, it is more important than ever to have national parks, national monuments, national seashores, national forests, etc as places to escape to where we can rejuvenate our souls.  And, just as important is to have a place for the birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, insects, and the variety of plants to grow and thrive without facing the possibility of extinction.  When other species of flora and fauna go extinct, so will we.  If any of them or any of the square mileage of any of them is reduced or any of the flowing rivers and creeks on those lands are affected by being used for other purposes -- eg grazing, mineral/oil development, etc, the land, the water and anything that lives there will never be the same again.  Please do not touch any of them or make any of them smaller,  Instead, we need to expand these unique places of beauty and their sources of natural resources.  Thanks you, Susan Taylor, PhD	0	\N	\N	\N

The buttes and surroundings have long been held as sacred or as integral heritage sites by a number of the region's Native American tribes. Ancestral Puebloan cliff dwellings dated to more than 3,500 years ago have been discovered in the region, just some of the estimated 100,000 archaeological sites protected within the monument. This area needs to continue to be protected for its historical and archaeological value, as well as its significance to Native American tribes.\n\nDon't you think we've done enough harm to the Native Americans? Do not go back on our word to respect their cultural and religious heritage sites. If this was in any way related to a biblical figure, it'd be a no brainer to protect it. Yet here you are, threatening to let corporations in here with bulldozers and other heavy equipment to rape the land, potentially destroying priceless artifacts which the Native Americans hold dear.\n\nDo not do this.

This precedent should stay intact. \nFurthermore, the revenue that these monuments generate as tourist attractions will far exceed the short term gains that could otherwise be generated through extraction-related industries. Finally, these monuments are national treasures, to rescind any sort of protections for the implied intent of private use and development is nothing short of treason. 	0	\N	\N	\N

I would even support something like the Fifty Mile Mountain as a Monument or Wilderness because there is almost no access. I believe in both the Bears Ears and GSENM cases the designations were political and meant to be a poke in the eye to local officials. The size of both Monuments without regard for specific sites to be protected or the intent of the Antiquities Act was improper. Especially since the lands in question were already public and federally managed. The coal mine in question was low sulfur coal and would have disturbed less than 40 acres. No Paleo devastation there. We should wisely use all energy production options recognizing that virtually all of them have side effects and negative impacts.

Many of the monuments on this list were not only created with locals' support but also in partnership with Native American tribes and other stakeholders.

I am a lifelong resident of Utah and enjoy motorized travel on the trail systems in the state.\nI am not saying that we need a road or trail on top of every mountain, but I do think we should keep the motorized access that we have now. I don't want to see massive development\nin these areas, but I do think that the Antiquities Act has been abused in both of the Monuments mentioned above. I believe that the Intent of the law is to protect the smallest amount of land, or area to safeguard a specific sight or \nitem, such as rock art or cliff dwellings, and other ancient structures. This would surely not amount to 1.3 million acres at the Bears Ears,  or 1.7 million of the Grand Staircase.\nLocking most of the people out of their public land is not the answer. Most of the local people are against these Monuments as they now exist.

There is so little land that is NOT already under development, or being used for resource extraction already. And I know when you look at the American West, it is easy to think the opposite is true. But think of it more this way: the American West is all that remains of wilderness. The entire United States used to be that way. It's not an environmentalist thing or part of a liberal agenda. This is a bipartisan point of view. Nobody wants America's beautiful backcountry turned into smokestacks and oil rigs. Especially somewhere as special as Bears Ears or Escalante - some of the most unique land I've seen anywhere in the world. It's just too emotionally charged, and for what? A dying industry? The outdoor industry creates three times as many jobs as the fossil fuels industry. We all know that sacrificing the outdoor recreation potential in Bears Ears, Escalante, or most of these other national monuments in exchange for resource extraction is a losing investment in the long run... not even in a very long run at all. And, of course, speaking of Bears Ears specifically, do we really want to hit Native Americans with just another in a seemingly endless procession of slaps to the face? For the first time, native peoples were consulted and central to the planning of a national monument. That's a step forwards toward reparations for past atrocities, and respect for native peoples. Do we really want to simply undo that giant step in the right direction for the sole purpose of putting more money in the pockets of the Koch brothers? The writing is on the wall. More and more, the word is getting out, and people see through the ruse. The motives behind this are transparent, and unacceptable. You know it, I know it, everyone knows it. And of course, the lens of history is more transparent still. Think about your legacy. Think of what you will be known for 50 years down the road. Think of your children, and their children, and how they will want to remember the Zinke name.\nThink about what it might mean to set this precedent of rescinding or restructuring national monuments (something no previous president has ever done, from either party). Think about what we stand to gain by doing so. And then, think about what we stand to lose.	0	\N	\N	\N

This precedent should stay intact.\nFurthermore, the revenue that these monuments generate as tourist attractions will far exceed the short term \ngains that could otherwise be generated through extraction-related industries. Finally, these monuments are national treasures, to rescind any sort of protections for the implied intent of private use and development is nothing short of treason.\n\n\nSincerely,\nNicholas Consiglio	0	\N	\N	\N

663	DOI-2017-0002-0663	2017-05-12	I am in my 60's and recently retired.  I have been deep into the wilderness and canyon areas of Southern Utah since I was a teenager.  I have camped at the Bear's Ears.  I have hiked into remote areas where Native Americans built their homes many years ago.  I have been deep in the canyons of the Escalante and other major drainages in the area.  I understand the need to preserve and protect these treasures.  I love these areas as much as anyone.\n\nWith all that said, the amount of acreage set aside in Bears Ears and Grand Staircase Escalate was WAY TOO MUCH.   They both need to be cut WAY BACK to something reasonable for protection of the more sensitive areas.  Of course, "protection" is an ill-defined term.  Unfortunately, the "protection" will just bring more people to the areas as they become more well known and popular.  There are certain areas within the borders of these large acreage monuments that are not that pretty, frankly.  To disallow their use for other purposes is a waste of what nature has provided.  \n\nThe key is BALANCE.  And there has not been any by the overriding, broad brush approach used by President Clinton and President Obama.  This is mostly all federal land anyway, and protections can be in place in a more pinpoint manner instead of such a broad brush.\n\nThanks for listening.\n	0	\N	\N	\N

688	DOI-2017-0002-0688	2017-05-12	As a resident of of southern Utah, who lives bordering the National Monument of The Grand Staircase-Escalante,I would like to voice my feelings and thought about the Monument. We would like to see the Monumnet status rescinded, so that we could have an increased access, and use of the monument and resources we need. We live in such a remote location, and cannot easily access wood for heating our home, which is a financial burden, and seems ridiculous we are surrounded by dead wood we are not allowed to collect. Also we feel it is wrong for the residents of Utah to not be able to reap the benefits of the additional natural resources like coal, and the financial benefits it would bring the surrounding communities who have a hard time making a living wage solely on the tourist industry. The only folks who benefit from from the tourist industry surrounding the monument is the business, while those who work for them cannot make a living wage.\nThe communities who border the monument are low income and should be able to use and benefit from the land they border without so much restriction as the Monument status has been put upon the use of the land.\nOur great country should not tie up valuable natural resources, like coal, and oil, it seems wasteful and foolish to the them up. The general consensus among local residents is that they resent the monument status, while those who are newer residents don't appreciate the fact that older residents who used the land more freely before the monument status, have  greater perspective from how it was before. \nAs Utah residents we love and value the land, and we don't need a monument to protect and cherish what it is. It's a fact that those who are in favor of rescinding the monument status, are not as noisy and apt to come forward as those who wish to keep the Monument status, as they are not minded like the activist who stand and make a lot of noise in favor of keeping the monument, so I worry that folks like me won't be heard, but I assure you they are more the majority none the less.	0	\N	\N	\N

I am against these new and unnecessary monument reviews where de-designation is being considered; such an unprecedented and unpopular decision would be "un-American," a term I do not use lightly. Instead, our federal government should be focused on the pressing matters of safeguarding our environments and global climate. In fact, I implore all those in the executive branch and in Congress to urgently work on 1) ending fossil fuel development and consumption to stop carbon emissions and 2) more scientific research and development of technological innovations that can help counteract the detrimental effects of the emissions ALREADY in the atmosphere, our oceans and elsewhere. There is not much time left for those in government to act at before the climate situation and extreme weather becomes nearly impossible for our societies and civilizations to withstand. I also remind those in government of the hard truth that those who refuse to act in responsible ways to safeguard our planet and climate are, in fact, complicit with the fossil fuels corporations (and their agents) who are committing mass ecocide and genocide through their decades-long unwillingness to stop their destruction of our atmosphere, lands and oceans. Renewable energies should have been more quickly developed and provided by our governments and responsible corporations way back in the 1970's! Therefore, the least that all those in government can do (especially those that swore to their oath of office) is to seriously help, not hinder, the U.S. in mitigating and adapting to our terrifying global warming problems and related climate change challenges which are escalating and  beginning to threaten everyone's well-being and basic survival.

Look at Cedar Mountain.  For 20 years they've let the beetle kill trees sit there waiting to burn, all because somebody was scared that logging would turn it into a giant speedbump.  Now they've got logging going on there, and it's making everything better up there AND got some people back to work.\n  Escalante is one of my favorite towns on earth, but I'm telling you right now if they don't get some solid jobs in there, there isn't going to be many generations left.  It's not that the kids want to leave; they HAVE to leave because there is no way to make a living and raise a family, because all of the usable land is locked up, sitting fallow, doing nothing while the true stewards of the land  (the families who settled this land and have been sticking with it for the past 130 years ) are barely getting by, at best.   If there is ANYONE that has the motivation and the knowledge to truly care for this land, it is those people who live off of it, not far-away bureaucrats who feel the best way to fix something that isn't broken is to break it first.\n   I'm all for parks and monuments, but not for million acre land grabs that strangle whole communities futures and, at best, set them back a whole generation,  If not just kill them outright.	0	\N	\N	\N

697	DOI-2017-0002-0697	2017-05-12	As an Oregonian who is a frequent visitor to Utah, I support the designation of Bears Ears National Monument and ask that its boundaries remain unchanged.\n\nFor more than 100 years, Presidents of both parties have used the Antiquities Act--a tool signed into law by Theodore Roosevelt--to enact far-sighted protections for our common American inheritance. Bears Ears is exactly the kind of place the Antiquities Act intended to protect. It is rich in cultural history which inspired a historic coalition of tribes to band together to push for its designation. In addition to protecting over 100,000 archaeological sites, the designation preserves world-class recreation opportunities in places like Cedar Mesa, Grand Gulch, and Indian Creek.\n\nThe process that led to the designation of Bears Ears National Monument was thorough and transparent. For more than 80 years, decision makers from all sides presented proposals seeking permanent protection of all or part of this incredible landscape. The boundaries were informed by both the multi-year Public Lands Initiative and by a proposal from the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition. Those boundaries do not exceed the acreage necessary to preserve the rich cultural heritage, ecological values, and recreation assets.\n\nThank you for reviewing the decades of hard work and thoughtful consideration that culminated in the designation of Bears Ears National Monument. Please recommend that President Trump leave the current Bears Ears National Monument boundaries in place.	0	\N	\N	\N

700	DOI-2017-0002-0700	2017-05-12	Hello Dept. of the Interior,\n\nIt is a great honor for me to have the opportunity to share my comment on the status of our National Monuments. I am currently a Biology professor at the University of San Diego. I have lived in Utah, Colorado, Oregon, Washington and California. The west is my home. Open space and public lands are my home. \n\nMuch like Ryan Zinke, I am a huge fan of Teddy Roosevelt. I strongly believe that our wilderness is the backbone and soul of our nation. I hunt and fish and camp and hike on many of the National Monuments currently under review. I would like to see that these lands remain protected for future generations. This was Teddy's intention when he created the Antiquities Act in 1906. \n\nIf the parcels of land being claimed as National Monuments are becoming too large, then let's find an appropriate size limit in the future. However, let us not redact or abolish a pre-existing monument. This would be unprecedented and a great disgrace to the taxpayer who has been footing the bill for maintaining these public lands. \n\nI am particularly opposed to any ruling that threatens Bears Ears and Grand Staircase/Escalante. I have spent time exploring the red rock wilderness in these regions, and I hope to continue visiting in the future.\n\nPlease do the right thing! Please honor Teddy Roosevelt's legacy and keep these lands designated as National Monuments.\n\nThanks for your time,\nDr. Kevin Curran\n	0	\N	\N	\N

702	DOI-2017-0002-0702	2017-05-12	Since entering a Bear Ears Cave 11 months ago, my days have begun and ended with questions, answers, research, and dozens of posts and e-mails all related to San Juan County's opposition to Bears Ears Monument. I am a 45 year resident of Blanding, Utah, but I was raised on a dry farm in Idaho.  My heart is now entwined with Bears Ears.\n\nWithout technology, the Bears Ears issue would have been dead in the water and surrounded by sharks months ago.  Even though the Internet has leveled the playing field, well-paid sharks are still circling, and It's not only in "monumental" waters (like Pacific Remote Islands Monument), but inland rural America faces sharks as well. It is noticeably evident that environmental paranoia has sunk to a new low. In their desperation to persuade and create a "maddening crowd", extremists have manufactured fake "news" and FB groups designed to lead the uninformed down a path of manipulation and hysteria - the kind that causes shouting matches at public hearings! \nThose who take the time to discover where the money comes from which triggers environmental propaganda, will see that green loan sharks are feeding America's fears and indebtedness, and payback for them appears directly related to land collateral. \n\n I learned a great deal about this by checking guidestar.org. I discovered that the Sierra Club's total income for 2015 was $5,350,618! Dumbfounded, I compare that to the $10,000 San Juan County's "No Monument" grass roots group made last year at Freedom Fest Concert, and ponder the implications. We do NOT pay CEOs, secretaries, or lobbyists.    \nThe Sierra Club paid over $2.355 million in salaries alone, in their "non-profit" business.  Unfortunately, their business is putting rural American out of business!  Part of their 2015 expenses included $536,221, plus another $19,606 in grants for "New Program Native American services and Logistical support for the Inter-tribal effort to secure Bears Ears National Monument." Money talks for sure, unfortunately it doesn't tell the truth about Bears Ears. \nThough not as big of a business, Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance's operational expenses for 2015 totaled $2,454,021.  Lobbying costs were $53,661; then they spent another $51,288 in advertising!  This information comes from tax return forms, from organizations "exempt from Income Tax." \n\nNow visualize those megabucks multiplying exponentially via hundreds of other "non-profit-tax exempt" environmental foundations across the nation. Frankly, I find it abhorrent and ironic that these NGO's accuse Utah's "elected" officials of being persuaded by big bucks from private businesses!  \n\nThe Grand Canyon Trust can certainly recognize big business when they see it, as they have many venture capitalists on their board of directors, who have much to gain by locking up public lands. They not only use the power of money to establish policies that suppress US citizens, but they strive to control lives and land in multiple states.\nThere are hundreds of board members of the same ilk nationwide, specifically chosen because of their MONEY, to serve on multiple environmental NGOs throughout the US and the world. We don't buy the lies (nor the products) when they claim they are free from the taint of money! \n \nOne Grand Canyon Trust director of special interest is David Bonderman. He also sits on the board of the Wilderness Society and the World Wildlife Fund and is a "major financier" of the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance and other green groups. He is also one of the most successful venture capitalists in America. Bonderman is a founding partner of TPG Capital and its Asian affiliate, Newbridge Capital.  Within his vast portfolio, TPG has invested heavily in the energy sector. In October 2010, TPG Capital formed a new venture, Petro Harvester Oil & Gas, LLC, to invest in oil and gas producing properties in North America. TPG expects the company will "acquire" substantial exploration and production ("E&P") assets over the next several years. Very suspect in our eyes.\n \nDespite the disparity in this David and Goliath battle, San Juan County remains optimistic that Secretary Zinke's fact finding trip will uncover the truth. Now that a coalition of "united" States has formed with other states who have been impacted negatively by Antiquities Act overreach, we are no longer just one insignificant rural area being targeted.  Bears Ears No Monument promoters have been joined by other in a common cause.  All of us are united in our desire to reclaim State's Rights.  Knowing the President has asked for a review of the Antiquated Antiquities Act, shows many are concerned. In the past 40 years Presidents have been influenced by global powers, and as a result the Antiquities Act has turned into a piranha feeding on the lives and livelihood of rural Americans. It is time that Congress acts to curtail its abuse. It's time for a 12-step recovery program for the Antiquities Act. \n\nSincerely, \nJanet Wilcox\n\n\n	1	\N	\N	\N
703	DOI-2017-0002-0703	2017-05-12	My name is Trina. I have lived in San Juan County, Utah for over 3 decades. My family has been here nearly 7 decades. I am asking Secretary Zinke and President Trump to rescind the Bears Ears National Monument for a number of reasons. \n\nFirst, the declaration of 1.35 million acres is an abuse of the antiquities act by which the monument was declared. \n\nSecond, the monument boundaries contain SITLA lands, which provide vital funding for our school children. San Juan County is already the poorest county in the state of Utah, so to take funding from our schools will be detrimental to both employees (such as my husband) and students (my daughter, for example). While I strongly want sacred sites protected (which they were before the monument designation), I also believe in multiple land use and anyone who drives a car, uses a cell phone or a laptop, or who flies on an airplane, has ever taken a city bus, or any number of other things that involve the use of oils and minerals extracted from the earth also believes in multiple land use, whether they will admit it or not. \n\nAnother reason I oppose a monument is because there were already 11 different types or layers of protections on the land. I believe National Monuments are sometimes the right answer to offer protection for an area, however, I do not believe it offers the type of protection this area needs. Those protections were already in place. Monument status has commercialized, advertised, and targeted a very remote area and has already drawn larger crowds in 6 months than this area has seen in decades. As a result, I have witnessed more destruction, desecration, and complete carelessness from visitors in the 11 months since Sally Jewell visited than I have seen in 3 decades of camping, hiking, and exploring the region. Drawing large crowds of people to an area is hardly offering protection. \n\nThe fourth reason I would like the monument rescinded is I heat my home with firewood that I obtain a permit to collect.  Within the monument proclamation, it states that Native Americans may continue to "gather" wood. I have three concerns with that statement. First, I am Anglo. That means I cannot gather wood anywhere within the 2,000 square mile monument to keep my family warm in the winter. While I am extremely glad it attempts to look out for my Native American friends and family by stating they can still "gather" wood, it leaves any other ethnicity out who would also like to heat their homes with wood. Second, the word "gather" is very vague and in other monument proclamations has been used to mean, in essence, whatever you can carry out on your back or with your bare hands. This makes it impossible to "gather" enough wood to heat a home through our harsh winters. Third, that "promise" can and likely will change at any given time. \n\nThe Monument proclamation also states that wood gathered cannot be used for commercial use. Many families, whose incomes are already very meager, often gather for the purpose of selling to supplement their incomes. This will be a tragic loss to their livelihood. \n\nThese are just a few of the many reasons I am asking for the Bears Ears National Monument to be rescinded. \n\nI would also like to take this opportunity to thank Secretary Zinke and President Trump for giving San Juan County locals an oportunity to voice our concerns. That is an opportunity that we were promised with former Secretary Jewell, but were never granted. Thank you!\n\nFrom a third generation San Juan County local, please rescind the Bears Ears National Monument.\n Thank you,\nTrina Hosler	0	\N	\N	\N

718	DOI-2017-0002-0718	2017-05-12	Our strength is in the individual; grass roots if you will. Our strongest private property rights outside the Constitution were the rights granted to us under the 1872 Mining Act. The 1872 Mining Act was based on the laws that miners established when they formed the original Mining Districts throughout the West. Those laws/rules worked so well they became codified into Federal Mining Law. We now have the FEDERALLY GRANTED RIGHT to access our mining claims, regardless of what arbitrary designation was slapped onto the land in the latest round of land and road closures (like the 1906 Antiquities Act which has been abused beyond it's original intent!). \n\nIt has been said that the people perish for lack of knowledge, and the people lose their rights for that same lack of knowledge. It's time for us to pick up the legal tools granted to us under Federal Mining Law and get to work reversing the trend that has been hammering away at our rights and locking up our Public Lands. We need to pick up the pieces that have been chipped off and reconstruct what has been lost. Undoing many of the National Monument designations is a good start, but this is only the first step in regaining control over the destiny of the Public Lands.\n\nJust as when the Mining Districts were first formed, people were elected to run the Districts and watch out for the rights of the individuals. Mining Claim rules were successfully worked out to such a degree that the basic rule structure that was in place was preserved in the 1866 and 1872 Mining Laws. These laws have also been reinforced by court cases and additional clarification laws down through the years. Public Lands for the People (PLP) is educating folks, informing them that the rights they have are far stronger than what they realized, and they have been losing those rights by not being informed and exercising those rights. \n\nMiners are not afraid of doing hard work and getting dirty. They know how to use picks and shovels to wrest gold and other minerals from the earth, thus creating wealth. The bureaucrats in DC and around the country seem to have forgotten this all important point: "If it's not grown, it's mined." It is the voice the miner, the off roader, the hunter, hiker, fisherman and anyone that gets "out there" on our public land that seems to be ignored. PLP and the Mining Districts are the voice and the muscle needed to preserve the freedom to use and enjoy OUR public lands, preserving the intent of what our country and mining laws were are based on, private property rights.\n\nOver 90% of raw materials used in the U.S. are mined in foreign countries. Critical  minerals needed for the national defense will not be available if they are allowed to be locked away in National Monuments. Now we are certainly for preserving the natural beauty of the wide open spaces, but there needs to be a sane balance between over use and locking up everything.\n\nPreservation along with Multiple Use on Federally Managed Land also strengthens rural economies.\n\nSo please strongly consider reversing the San Gabriel, Sand to Snow, Mojave Trails, and all National Monuments that were created in recent years abusing the Antiquities Act and have significant mineral wealth beneath them. Castle Mountains Monument is not on the list to be reconsidered because it is under the size threshold, but should be considered for the reasons mentioned above.\n\nThank you,\n\nRon Kliewer\n\nPresident\n\nPublic Lands for the People\nwww.publiclandsforthepeople.org \n	0	\N	\N	\N
719	DOI-2017-0002-0719	2017-05-12	Growing up back east in New Hampshire I always felt drawn to the west where the land is vast, the land is open to all, and adventure awaits. Sure, NH has some decent public land too, which I enjoyed as a kid, hiking and skiing in the White Mountains National Forest and camping out wherever and whenever I could. During college in upstate New York, I got into the State Forests and Adirondack State Park often. Good stuff! After college I headed west and have since lived in Wyoming, Colorado, and now California. I cannot stress enough how much public lands mean to me. The feeling of utter freedom that one gets when heading out into the forest, or desert, getting away from the masses, and connecting with nature is so primal to me, so necessary in my life. These wild lands are also so essential for the preservation of our wildlife. I am so thankful that our predecessors were mindful of this and have set up such a great system of land preservation to be enjoyed by all for generations to come. It is of the utmost importance that we continue to protect our wild places, that we keep public lands public, and that we absolutely do not open National Parks or National Monuments to extractive industry. The only way an extractive industry project should ever be allowed on BLM or Forest Service land is after a thorough NEPA review process. Please do not make the mistake of rescinding the designation of any of our National Monuments.	0	\N	\N	\N
720	DOI-2017-0002-0720	2017-05-12	This letter regards Executive Order 13792, and specifically Bears Ears National Monument in southeastern Utah.\n\nBears Ears is home to several thousand archaeological sites. The sites themselves as well as the landscape are sacred to several Native American tribes. As such, the advocacy group Utah Din Bikeyah formed from a collaborative effort between these tribes to protect this landscape. If there ever was a place that the Antiquities Act seems "written for," Bears Ears most certainly seems like it. When President Obama designated the national monument in December 2008, it was was worthy of celebration because the preservation of these sites is now guaranteed as part of our national heritage. President Obama's proclamation was also a testament to the sovereignty of these tribes, and the importance of their history to the nation.\nWithin the monument, recreational activities that were permissible before the monument designation are still allowed. With a permit, people can still gather firewood, herbs, and shrubs. Thus, the use and enjoyment of the land has not been affected. However, I am writing this letter to specifically address two other arguments against Bears Ears. The first is the size of the monument, and the economic impact that could have on local communities.\n\nIn 2013, Representatives Rob Bishop and Jason Chaffetz put forward what they called the Public Lands Initiative (PLI), in which they would set aside part of the Bears Ears region as a national recreation area, which would essentially provide the same protections from oil and gas development or uranium mining as a monument designation under the Antiquities Act. Utah Din Bikeyah proposed a similar, albeit larger, set of borders for their visualized national monument.\n\nWhen the Obama administration designated Bears Ears National Monument, the borders they drafted more closely matched the national recreation area proposed in the PLI than those proposed by Utah Din Bikeyah. What's more, GIS data from the state of Utah show that the majority of oil and gas wells currently lie outside of the monument (possibly due to low success and complex terrain for drilling). The area's most significant coal reserves lie completely outside of the monument boundaries. No areas within the monument are currently classified as having "high potential" for uranium mines either. When the monument was created, these data must surely have been available to the Obama administration when they designated Bears Ears.\n\nFinally, critics have expressed concern for Utah's schools. There are several inholdings of state trust land parcels within Bears Ears; they cannot be developed for mineral extraction because they lie within the monument. In 1996, when President Clinton designated Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, the federal government and the state eventually "swapped" for 139,000 acres of federal land that was outside of the monument with the Utah Trust Lands Administration for those types of private inholdings. In addition, the federal government paid the state of Utah $50 million. To date, the mineral extraction that has resulted from that swapped land has yielded ~$1.7 billion in revenue for the state of Utah. Senator Bennett called this was a "model for future land swaps," and I agree with him. It was a win-win for all parties, and I believe it could work equally well in Bears Ears.\n\nI grew up in the northwestern corner of New Mexico, and had many backpacking outings in the Bears Ears region. With my dad, and with my Boy Scout troop, we explored many of the canyons on Cedar Mesa, and saw many of the archaeological sites that are now protected. These are some of my fondest memories of time spent in the outdoors. Just like so many of our national parks and monuments, Bears Ears is one of our national treasures. As Westerners, we are bound to protect these lands; it is not in our nature to hastily exploit them for short-term gain. The preservation of Bears Ears keeps a promise to past and future generations, and is one that can transcend partisan politics. Please join me in standing with Bears Ears and making it our nation's common ground.	1	\N	\N	\N

735	DOI-2017-0002-0735	2017-05-12	Bears Ears National Monument is a national treasure. It should be permanently maintained in its entirety as a National Monument due to its significant cultural, archeological, and economic value to local Native American tribes, the state of Utah, and the United States. \n\nDespite its recent designation, the establishment of a National Monument surrounding Bears Ears is far from a new concept, as its public value has been recognized for nearly a century. The area has been the object of National Monument designation since the 1930s attempt to create an Escalante National Monument three times the current size of Bears Ears National Monument. More recently, Native American tribes in the Four Corners area have sought the protection of Bears Ears for nearly a decade prior to President Obama's executive order creating Bears Ears National Monument. The Bears Ears buttes and surrounding land are spiritually important to multiple Native American tribes in the area. Among other antiquities, Bears Ears holds the burial grounds of the Navajo leader Manuelito, which are sacred to the Navajo people. The president of the Navajo Nation has stated on the record that the tribe has "always looked to Bears Ears as a place of refuge, as a place where we can gather herbs and medicinal plants, and a place of prayer and sacredness," while a member of the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe has stated that the monument is important to him "because these are ancestral lands...there are sacred sites and stories of our lives." Bears Ears is home to a number of such antiquities, including architecturally significant ancestral Puebloan cliff dwellings that date to 1500 BC. In total, the National Monument contains an estimated 100,000 archeological sites, many of which have previously been victim to, and need protection from, looting and vandalism.\n\nExecutive Order #13792 directs Secretary Zinke to review Monuments in part based on "concerns of State, tribal, and local governments affected by a designation," as well as  \n "whether designated lands are appropriately classified under the act as "historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, [or] other objects of historic and scientific interest." Clearly, Bears Ears possesses significant value in both categories, given the extensive archeological relevance of the area as well as its spiritual and ancestral importance to Native peoples who have called it home for many generations. It would be deeply irresponsible to ignore these factors, each of which align Bears Ears National Monument with the very essence of the Antiquities Act, to shortsightedly pursue profit from destructive industrial use of this land. \n\nNotably, Bears Ears National Monument borders Canyonlands National Park and Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, and Natural Bridges National Monument, demonstrating that its surrounding region has previously and separately been deemed to carry notable value to the American public. Furthermore, it is important to note that a large portion of the land for which an intertribal coalition requested protection in Bears Ears National Monument was not included in the Monument's eventual borders. Given the Secretary's instructions to consider "that reservations of land not exceed the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management..."it is evident that the borders of Bears Ears National Monument were already drawn with an eye towards omitting unnecessary lands.\n\nThe economic value of Bears Ears National Monument is also not to be understated. Beyond its importance to local Native tribes, Bears Ears is prized by the outdoor industry. Secretary Zinke is also instructed to consider the effects of the National Monument on "the economic development and fiscal condition of affected States, tribes, and localities." It is notable that Outdoor Retailer Market, with a cumulative economic impact of an estimated $45 million each year, withdrew indefinitely from the state of Utah in protest of the Utah government's opposition to Bears Ears, with the weight of major companies such as Patagonia, REI, and The North Face behind this decision. Although a remote area for much other economic activity, Southeast Utah is a hub for the outdoor industry and a major destination for adventure and outdoor tourism in large part due to its protected lands such as Bears Ears. According to NPS, nearby national parks such as Zion and Arches generated about $850 million in annual visitor spending and created 14,000 jobs - overall, Utah receives a $1.3 billion economic boost annually from parks and monuments. In light of all of the above considerations, it is unsurprising that in a recent poll, 71% of Utah residents supported the continued protected status of Bears Ears.\n\nGiven the major archeological, spiritual, cultural, and economic importance of Bears Ears National Monument, I strongly support its continued preservation in the entirety of its current dimensions.	0	\N	\N	\N
744	DOI-2017-0002-0744	2017-05-12	The designation of National Monuments is a process that takes years of analysis, review, and public comment. We protect these monuments out of respect for nature, history, and public use. These protections have been honored for generations by both liberals and conservatives, and by both progressives and libertarians.\n\nThe premise for this 'review' is a farce, hiding the goals of commercial and industrial development behind the premise that reducing publicly protected lands is somehow being done to the benefit of the public that has chosen to protect them.\n\nNo president has ever abolished or revoked the proclamation of a national monument. Unlike the Pickett Act and forest service law, the Antiquities Act provides no provision for proclamations made under that act to be vacated. In 1938, the Attorney General opined to FDR that the Antiquities Act does not grant the president the power to abolish existing national monuments. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act prohibits the Interior Secretary from modifying or revoking any protected lands created under the Antiquities Act. 	0	\N	\N	\N

Furthermore, the Las Vegas Metro Chamber of Commerce, the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, and a number of major employers including MGM Resorts International, the largest employer in Nevada, supported the establishment of Basin and Range as a National Monument. Clearly, the Las Vegas tourism industry and the State of Nevada consider the preservation of Basin and Range a priority from an economic perspective.\n\nSecretary Zinke is also directed to consider "whether designated lanes are appropriately classified under the act as "historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, [or] other objects of historic and scientific interest." Native American rock art at the Shooting Gallery rock art site, the Mount Irish area, North Pahroc Range, and White River Narrows clearly fit this categorization, as do 19th century settlements and Native American sites. Human inhabitance of the Basin and Range National Monument dates to the Clovis era circa 11,000 BC, and the area is believed to contain rich archeological information about not only the Clovis, but also the Western Pluvial Lakes Tradition hunters, Desert Archaic civilizations from 6,000 BC to 500 AD, and the Southern Paiute and Western Shoshone tribes of Native Americans. Additionally, Michael Heizer's "City" art project in Garden Valley is a massive work of art in progress and is supported by museums the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. \n\nBasin and Range is additionally an important component of the National Conservation Lands. It is home to golden eagles, desert bighorn sheep, and a wide variety of other flora and fauna, many of them threatened or endangered. In fact, Nevada has the third most listed species of any state. The unique ecoregion of the Great Basin makes it home to many endemic species that exist nowhere else. Large, contiguous areas of protected land such as Basin and Range National Monument are necessary to ensure the preservation of intact habitat blocks and safeguard the ecological diversity and integrity of the region. \n\nThe Secretary is instructed to consider "that reservations of land not exceed the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management...". The aforementioned characteristics of Basin and Range National Monument provide a clear basis for the sustained protection of the National Monument in its entirety. \n\nFor the reasons above, I strongly support the continued maintenance and preservation of Basin and Range as a National Monument in the entirety of its current dimensions. 	0	\N	\N	\N

I lived 50 years before I realized that these special places are OUR lands - they belong to ordinary Americans like ME. When I finally awoke to that fact I worked especially hard so that I could save money and make a plan to travel to see them. I was scared 10 years ago that the government was going to close the parks before I got a chance to see them.\n\nWell, I sold my home, retired early and set off - just me and my two cats - to see as many of the National Parks as I could. I saw 48 of the 59 National Parks before my sister and 85 year old mother needed me to come home and help them. While I traveled I volunteered over 4000 hours working at visitor centers, camphosting, leading tours and cleaning up after people. I met and helped tjousands of people from around the world discover the treasure of our undisturbed lands. They all traveled thousands of miles to see OUR COUNTRY! For me, this was a humbling experience and made me love my country as never before.\n\nThe thought that the current administration is even thinking of reversing the protected status of some national properties, to say nothing of relaxing environmental regulations putting our ecosystem in grave peril, or possibly raping these lands for evonomic gain makes me furious. And I am willing to fight the powers trying to do this to us.\n\nI urge congressional members to PLEASE PROTECT OUR NATIONAL PROPERTIES!

It is a walking experience through eons of sedimentary rock formation and then eons of erosion by water and wind.  It also has the greatest existing record of early peoples in our country.   I live in the Pacific NorthWest and work on trail crews spending significant time in the mountains and expansive forest of Washington state which are managed by the Federal government.  It is, however,  to the remote landscapes of Utah that I most long to be when I have time for adventure and exploration.  I have never been to a place that feels more cosmic and more remote than the Colorado Plateau in southern Utah.  I have recreated in both Staircase Escalante National Monument and the canyons of Bears Ears National Monument.  They are among my favorite places. \n\nErasing the history of the land, our governing traditions, and unique natural wonder for a quick buck and to extend a dying industry is a shame.    Natural gas and solar are cheaper and more viable.   Wyoming coal struggles to find a port to ship overseas because taxpaying Americans don't want coal ports in their backyards.  The natural gas industry is booming throughout the country and in areas like the White River in Utah.  It is not lacking in supply or areas of extraction.  The market is flooded and does not need redistributive handouts from the government.\n\nThe canyons, geological wonders, and artifacts of Bears Ears and Staircase- Escalante were protected because they are unique.  They were protected because people care about them and asked for their protection.  Congress has reviewed, updated the boundaries and exchanged land with the state of Utah regarding the boundaries of Staircase- Escalante.  Bears Ears went through a public input process that looks to be far more substantial than than the process you have begun.  The economy of tourism is established, growing, and sustainable in Southern Utah. Only you and your boss have the power (and desire) to destroy it. \n\nThe Page (Arizona) Coal power plant visible from Staircase- Escalante is going out of business due to the economics alone.  It just so happens that this will return millions of gallons of water to the Colorado River/ Lake Powell and that cubic tons of toxins will no longer be released into the atmosphere and landscape.  The coal industry is in a death spiral due to reasons beyond a purported lack of federal subsidies for it.  \n\nSecretary Zinke, you were elected by nobody but your constituents in Montana.\n\nCalling something an abuse just because you disagree with it is transparent politics and insulting.  What would be an abuse would be the first reversal of an presidential monument not done by an act of Congress. If you have a case,  take it to Congress.\n\nYou have come to this position due to a unique political moment in our country.  Please take heart that cuts to the Interior and Agriculture for greater spending on walls and bombs is a sad moment in history for you to be involved.  Please take it upon yourself to fight for conserving our national wild areas and cultural artifacts not selling them off.  You are being watched and judged by me and others.   I don't care about your ridiculous pony riding photo ops or press conferences statements.  I am watching and will judge you by your actions.\n\nPlease review these National Monuments and affirm they are worth saving.  If you disagree, make a recommendation to Congress.   Once you break precedent, it may be the public lands you hold dear that the next short sighted political moment will be after next.  Good luck!\n\nBrandon Alleman\nPortland, OR\n.\n	0	\N	\N	\N

Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument holds great value to the Bay Area region, the state of California, and the United States. Prior to its 2015 establishment as a National Monument by President Obama, Berryessa was under consideration by Congress as a National Conservation Area. Local Congressmen Mike Thompson and John Garamendi led this effort and championed the National Monument designation of Berryessa Snow Mountain, with the support of the California State Legislature, the Elem Indian Colony of Pomo Indians, local political leaders from Lake County, Yolo, and Solano, local conservationists, recreation enthusiasts, business owners, and landowners. Congressman Garamendi recently penned a public letter in support of Berryessa's continued protection in the Record-Bee (http://www.record-bee.com/article/NQ/20170504/LOCAL1/170509901). Rarely do so many diverse stakeholders express such unified support for protection of important lands. Consequently, in response to President Trump's executive order, the local area has expressed its readiness for a political and legal fight to protect the National Monument. Clearly, the "concerns of State, tribal, and local governments affected by [the] designation" are aligned in favor of the permanent protection of Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument.\n\nAs a large, beautiful, protected area within easy driving distance of the Bay Area metro region, Barryessa Snow Mountain National Monument will draw visitors year-round to the area, creating jobs and growing the local economy. In fact, many businesses in the local area are driven by tourism supported by the protection of these lands. Over half of CA residents participate in outdoor recreation, and preservation of areas like Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument provides important support for CA's $6 billion outdoor recreation economy. Notably, no private lands were impinged by the National Monument designation, nor were water rights, ranchers' grazing rights, motorized recreation, hunting, or fishing. The National Monument protects Lake Berryessa, which provides both water and hydro-powered electricity to the North Bay area. Short-sighted resource exploitation would endanger all of this, and would not be in the economic best interest of the region, CA, or the US.\n\nBerryessa Snow Mountain National Monument is also an ecologically important location that demands protection in its entirety. Snow Mountain in particular is an ecologic hotspot, with one of the highest densities of biodiversity in the state. The region is home to California's second largest population of wintering bald eagles, as well as the nearly-extinct Pacific Fisher, golden eagles, northern spotted owls, martens, black bears, mountain lions, river otters, black-tailed deer, tule elk, chinook salmon, and steelhead, among other notable ecological highlights such as a variety of rare plants. These lands are especially in need of permanent preservation to ensure a block of contiguous, intact habitat for at-risk species. \n\nExecutive Order #13792 further instructs Secretary Zinke to consider "whether designated lands are appropriately classified under the act as "historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, [or] other objects of historic and scientific interest." Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument has been home to a long history of native peoples, including the Yuki, Nomlaki, Patwin, Pomo, Huchnom, Wappo, Laki Miwok, and Wintum indigenous peoples. The significance of this legacy is evident in the cultural sites that cover the National Monument, from seasonal hunting and gathering camps to ancient villages, quarries, tool artifacts, petroglyphs, and trade routes of ancient indigenous peoples. More recent remains of homesteading dating to the 1840s gold rush, milling, and railroad logging are additional important historic artifacts. This history is archeologically significant, of obvious public interest, and in need of continued preservation. \n\nLocated near the Bay Area, Berryessa Snow Mountain provides the rare refuge and recreation spot that is simultaneously wild yet highly accessible to a major population center. Due to the significant cultural, archeological, and historic importance of the area, its notable biodiversity, and the strong support for its preservation by diverse stakeholders, Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument should be permanently protected under its current status.\n	0	\N	\N	\N
750	DOI-2017-0002-0750	2017-05-12	I think the Bears Ears needs to be rescinded because there's not anything that needs protected under monument status and feel that it can be protected without it being a monument and it does not meet monument status with it's size and the same goes for Grand Staircase Escalante. The Grand Staircase is larger than Bears Ears and is the size of the state of Delaware and we don't need a monument that big. I think the only thing that should be under monument status in the Grand Staircase is the Kaiparowits Plateau and the Skutumpah and the rest should go away. We do not need to protect sage brush, Trees, cheat grass, and slick rock which you see driving from Boulder to Escalante. I also feel that the Burr Trail that you drive down when driving through Boulder should be erased from monument status. There are grazing allotments down the burr trail that have been restricted because of the monument and if you are a rancher and try to go get water to your cattle you will get ticketed. There are also roads that are closed that are supposed to be open. When we try to go use the roads that were open in the past are now closed. You can't collect rocks or firewood on the monument. Studies are required and not being done. My brother has tried to apply for grazing permit on the monument 3 times and has been denied. This is a witness of mismanagement and the attitude of keeping people off the land increase. There was once a sawmill in Escalante that employed many people which is not in operation anymore. I feel that we need this land for multiple use. Millions of acres of land is not a monument. A monument is like the Lincoln Memorial or the Washington Monument in Washington DC or Mount Rushmore. They are something of historical, natural, or national importance. That is why we need to Shrink the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument. The fear is if we don't take action and downsize or rescind our monuments there will be more monument designations in the state of Utah that we don't need. Business owners think that reducing the size of Grand Staircase will kill their business which is not true.They are doing well now and will continue to do well with a smaller Grand Staircase. More people move to my town that don't have employment. There are more residents on welfare in my town than in any other town. We have tried for 20 years of the monument and it is not working for many. We don't like it. This is the time to make it better for all. Some have made the argument that there is a difference between more recent move ins and the old timers. All are welcome. The idea is that residents who have been here before the monument know what life was like before the monument. They also know how important the relationship with the government agencies is to cattle business, how it effects their business. That relationship is now strained. Some people don't have that perspective. Ranchers are the first conservationists. They are interested in clearing stream beds so water can get to their grazing lands. They took care of fences. It mattered that there was good growth on lands. They made the first roads. Their food source depended on the land. Please use your influence and shrink the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument. I agree with Utah Governor Gary Herbert that Utah will be okay with the changes. We need to have Multi use of our lands and not just for one group of people. We can all live with it. Thank you for your time in reading this and your consideration of my Thoughts are appreciated!	0	\N	\N	\N
751	DOI-2017-0002-0751	2017-05-12	Canyons of the Ancients National Monument should be permanently maintained in its entirety as a National Monument due to its significant cultural, archeological, and ecologic value to local Native American tribes, the local region, the state of Colorado, and the United States. \n\nExecutive Order #13792 directs Secretary Zinke to consider the status of Canyons of the Ancients National Monument in part through the lens of "whether designated lanes are appropriately classified under the act as "historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, [or] other objects of historic and scientific interest." As its name suggests, Canyons of the Ancients National Monument protects an area of ancient indigenous habitation. Humans have inhabited the National Monument area for over 10,000 years, and numerous Pueblo ruins in the National Monument date to the 11th to 13th centuries. In fact, Canyons of the Ancients contains the highest density of archeological remains anywhere in the United States, with over 20,000 sites identified including over 6,000 structures. These ruins are at severe risk of destruction from resource extraction in the area and must be protected from such activities (it is notable that drilling activities have been allowed to continue in the National Monument, with proper consideration of archeological and historical sites). Canyons of the Ancients also contains three Wilderness study areas of scientific interest and ecological relevance, and is the habitat of a broad range of desert plants and animals that would be placed at risk by further industrial development in the area.\n\nSecretary Zinke is also directed to review Monuments in part based on "the economic development and fiscal condition of affected States, tribes, and localities." Tourism is an essential base industry in Southwest Colorado, adding approximately 9,000 jobs with a combined annual income of $234 million and providing in total 17% of employment in the region. Canyons of the Ancients National Monument brings 50,000 visitors per year to the region while operating on a shoestring budget of less than 10% of the funding per acre of neighboring Mesa Verde National Park. \n\nThe incredible ruins of Canyons of the Ancients National Monument demand permanent protection for the benefit of future generations. A 2016 Colorado State study of America's National Park System "demonstrates that more than half of the total economic value of national parks is attributable to the benefits the American public receives from just knowing the National Park System is protected for current and future generations." Given the architectural and historical significance of Canyons of the Ancients National Monument, that principle clearly applies to this case, and it should continue to be permanently protected.	0	\N	\N	\N

755	DOI-2017-0002-0755	2017-05-12	Carrizo Plain National Monument should be permanently maintained in its entirety as a National Monument due to its significant cultural, archeological, and ecologic value to local Native American tribes, the local region, the state of California, and the United States. \n\nCarrizo Plain is the largest native grassland area that still exists in the state of California and the home to many archeologically and culturally relevant sites. The hundreds of significant cultural sites within the Monument include 10,000-year-old indigenous campsites and 1800s-era homesteads that show the ways of life in the area throughout its long history, as well as Painted Rock and other pictograph-containing spiritual sites of the Chumash. These sites have historically been threatened by vandalism and demand continued protection to maintain for use by future generations.\n\nCarrizo Plain is also home to over a dozen endangered species, including the California condor, greater and lesser sandhill cranes, the San Joaquin kit fox, the San Joaquin antelope squirrel, the giant kangaroo rat, and the blunt-nosed leopard lizard, and contains the largest concentration of endangered species in California. The combination of Carrizo Plain National Monument and Carrizo Plain Natural Area are essential for the management and preservation of this habitat. Carrizo Plain is also home to Soda Lake, the largest natural alkali wetland left in Southern California and a stunning section of the San Andreas Fault. \n\nWithin a 100-mile drive from Los Angeles, Carrizo Plain National Monument was recently the subject of viral nationwide celebration due to its "superbloom" following favorable spring weather conditions. Due to its greatly increased visibility as a result of this phenomenon, we can expect a continued increase in interest from the public and growing numbers of visitors to the area. Due to the cultural and archeological relevance of the area and its ecological sensitivity, Carrizo Plain should continue to receive federal protection to preserve it for use by future generations. 	0	\N	\N	\N
756	DOI-2017-0002-0756	2017-05-12	I strongly oppose this review of the status of declared National Monuments.  Each of these monuments already were extensively reviewed, and public comments were taken into account, before they were established.  Each monument provides important open space, natural habitat, and cultural preservation.  This newly ordered review process is, in my opinion, nothing more than an attempt to wrest public lands from the people in order to generate profit for greedy private corporations.  I demand that all of the existing national monuments be left intact for the benefit of all Americans.  Thank you.	0	\N	\N	\N
757	DOI-2017-0002-0757	2017-05-12	Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument should be permanently maintained in its entirety as a National Monument due to its significant cultural, archeological, and ecologic value to local Native American tribes, residents of the local region, the state of Oregon, and the United States. \n\nExecutive Order #13792 directs Secretary Zinke to review Monuments in part based on "concerns of State, tribal, and local governments affected by a designation, including the economic development and fiscal condition of affected States, tribes, and localities." Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument is supported by a diverse group of stakeholders across southern Oregon including neighboring property owners, local chambers of commerce, sportsmen, and Native tribes. At a public hearing in Ashland, the closest city to the National Monument, citizens testified in favor of the Monument expansion by nearly 3:1. A written comment period by Oregon's senators received feedback nearly 4:1 in favor of the monument. All of the above occurred prior to the decision to expand the National Monument, demonstrating the careful consideration of local stakeholders that went into the proclamation and the Monument's diverse public support. The recent expansion of Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument has been formally endorsed by Oregon Senators Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden, the late Oregon State Senator Alan Bates, Oregon State Representative Peter Buckley, the Mayors of Ashland and Talent, the Chambers of Commerce of both cities, and the City Councils of both cities.\n\nThe Secretary is also directed to consider "the effects of a designation on the available uses of designated Federal lands, including consideration of...multiple-use policy." It is important to note that the considerations of the timber industry were taken into account prior to the expansion of Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument, resulting in the preservation of logging access to thousands of acres within the boundaries of the National Monument. Thus, this consideration has already been taken into thoughtful account.\n\nThe Secretary is further instructed to consider "that reservations of land not exceed the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management...". Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument was the first monument created primarily in order to defend biodiversity. Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon points out that "after its modest expansion, it more fully encompasses an important ecological crossroads in an area of unique geology, biology, climate, and iconic American landscapes - where the volcanoes of the Cascade Range, the sage and juniper of the Basin and Range Province, and the world-renowned biodiversity of the Klamath-Siskiyou Mountains converge." The expansion of the National Monument was supported by a report by 85 scientists discussing the need to expand the existing monument significantly in order to achieve adequate protection of the objects of interest that the initial monument was conceived in order to protect. Previous scientific assessment of the need to protect the entire boundaries of the as-currently-drawn borders should preclude any question of the legitimacy of the National Monument on this front.\n\nAs the ecological need for the fully expanded borders of Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument was thoroughly discussed and diverse stakeholders were consulted prior to its expansion, and local and regional stakeholders overwhelmingly support the National Monument's protection in its entirety, its status should not be up for review. I wholeheartedly support the continued protection of Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument in its entirety.	0	\N	\N	\N

I was wowed by the spectacular landscape of lava flows, volcanic remnants and sparse vegetation. The amazing flood basalt features have no parallel in the United States and offer a textbook display of volcanic features. Craters of the Moon National Monument is a national treasure that was intended to be preserved for future generations, and the Trump administration should honor the commitment that the government has made for nearly a century.\n\nExecutive Order #13792 directs Secretary Zinke to consider "that reservations of land not exceed the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management...". The expansion of Craters of the Moon National Monument in 2000 followed years of request by geologists, biologists, and conservationists to expand the monument and create a national park in order to protect the entirety of the Great Rift zone. The existing boundaries of the National Monument are quite compact around the three lava fields of the Great Rift zone, and furthermore already includes an unusual compromise to allow hunting within the National Monument. \n\nSecretary Zinke is also instructed to review Monuments in part based on "concerns of State, tribal, and local governments affected by a designation, including the economic development and fiscal condition of affected States, tribes, and localities." It is notable in this regard that the Idaho Senate voted two months ago (March 2017) to petition the United States Congress to establish Craters of the Moon as a National Park. Thus it is evident that Idaho would prefer greater protection of Craters of the Moon, not less. The National Monument draws 250,000 people annually to a rural part of Idaho, serving as a gateway to the state for tourists from across the United States and around the world. The National Park Service estimates that as of 2015, Craters of the Moon National Monument supports over 130 jobs in the local area and creates $9.5 million of cumulative annual benefit to the local economy. \n\nGiven the value of Craters of the Moon National Monument as a unique geologic and environmental spectacle, its economic benefit to the surrounding region and its support by the state of Idaho, as well as the careful drawing of boundaries during its 2000 expansion, I strongly support the continued protection of the National Monument in the entirety of its current borders. In fact, I second the Idaho State Senate's petition to the United States Congress to establish Craters of the Moon as a National Park, in order to provide it with the greater protection it deserves.	0	\N	\N	\N
759	DOI-2017-0002-0759	2017-05-12	Giant Sequoia National Monument should be permanently maintained in its entirety as a National Monument due to its significant cultural, archeological, ecologic, and economic value to its local region, the state of California, and the United States. \n\nThe giant sequoia, the largest living tree in the world, grows in only 68 groves, all on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada in California within a narrow range of elevations. Between its two sections, Giant Sequoia National Monument contains 38 of these sequoia groves within its 300,000 acres. Executive Order #13792 directs Secretary Zinke to consider "whether designated lands are appropriately classified under the Act as "historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, or other objects of historic or scientific interest."" The preservation of half of the remaining groves of the world's most majestic trees is obviously of major scientific interest (and given the fact that sequoias are among the longest-lived organisms in the world, they should also be considered prehistoric structures). Secretary Zinke is also directed to consider "that reservations of land not exceed the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management...". The National Monument is already nestled tightly within two tightly-drawn areas of Sequoia National Forest and is does not waste space in protecting the giant sequoia groves it encompasses. \n\nExecutive Order #13792 further directs Secretary Zinke to review Monuments in part based on "concerns of State, tribal, and local governments affected by a designation, including the economic development and fiscal condition of affected States, tribes, and localities." A recent report by Headwaters Economics (https://headwaterseconomics.org/wp-content/uploads/Sequioa.pdf) shows that in the eight years following establishment of Giant Sequoia National Monument, the surrounding region experienced a steady increase in employment and income. Travel and tourism make up 15% of private employment in the Giant Sequoia Region, providing over 50,000 jobs as of 2008. In another recent study (https://headwaterseconomics.org/wp-content/uploads/monuments-summary-update-2014.pdf), Headwaters reports that across 17 recently established National Monuments, economic indicators such as per capita income improved in the regions surrounding every single National Monument studied, creating a rise in personal wealth in the largely rural surrounding areas. It is particularly important to note the exceptional importance of the outdoor recreation industry in the state of California. The Outdoor Industry Foundation reports that recreation contributes over $85 billion annually to the state economy, directly creating 732,000 jobs. (https://outdoorindustry.org/images/ore_reports/CA-california-outdoorrecreationeconomy-oia.pdf). As part of the popular NPS network in California, Giant Sequoia National Monument plays an important role in the outdoor tourism landscape. \n\nGiant Sequoia National Monument possesses significant and unique ecologic and scientific value, and is additionally a popular tourism destination that contributes to the economy of the surrounding area. I strongly support its continued protection as a National Monument in the entirety of its current borders. In fact, I would prefer to upgrade it a National Park to match the level of protection afforded to its NPS neighbors Kings Canyon National Park and Sequoia National Park.	0	\N	\N	\N
760	DOI-2017-0002-0760	2017-05-12	Honestly, after only a few months, I am already sick and tired of our president's ignorant and misguided "leadership," and this move is yet a further step in the wrong direction.\n\nLike tens of millions of other Americans, I strongly support our nation's public lands, including the National Monuments. In my view, this move is a blatant attempt at stripping protections from lands that belong to all Americans. The trumpet call is often heralded as giving control over public lands back to "the states," when, in reality, the ultimate goal of those making these demands is altogether removing protections, opening these areas for private acquisition. Those who stand to benefit are not the public at large, but rather the ultra wealthy and corporations that seek to exploit our natural resources.\n\nI worked for the National Park Service for several years, and I also feel a strong bond to our public lands. In my opinion, Teddy Roosevelt, John Muir, and many others, had the foresight and courage to preserve these areas, which are one of the things that makes our country great. We need these wild placesall of themfor solitude, recreation, learning, and the multitude of outdoor experiences that help make our lives better. In a time when population growth, habitat loss, and ever-increasing development threaten the relatively little minimally developed or wild places remaining, we need these public lands more than ever. Please: do not let the whims of a shortsighted, capricious president (and those with ulterior motives who enable him) undermine our nation.\n\nI strongly urge you to do everything in your power to maintain our country's network of National Monuments, including the seven here in California threatened by President Trump's myopic order.	0	\N	\N	\N
761	DOI-2017-0002-0761	2017-05-12	Gold Butte National Monument should be permanently maintained in its entirety as a National Monument due to its significant cultural, archeological, and ecologic value to local Native American tribes, the local region, the state of Nevada, and the United States. \n\nExecutive Order #13792 directs Secretary Zinke to consider "whether designated lands are appropriately classified under the Act as "historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, or other objects of historic or scientific interest."" This question should not be in any doubt for Gold Butte National Monument. President Obama's proclamation establishing Gold Butte as a National Monument specifically cited its many important factors deserving of protection (https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/12/28/presidential-proclamation-establishment-gold-butte-national-monument). Specifically, the proclamation notes that "The Gold Butte area contains an extraordinary variety of diverse and irreplaceable scientific, historic, and prehistoric resources, including vital plant and wildlife habitat, significant geological formations, rare fossils, important sites from the history of Native Americans, and remnants of our Western mining and ranching heritage. The landscape reveals a story of thousands of years of human interaction with this harsh environment and provides a rare glimpse into the lives of Nevada's first inhabitants, the rich and varied indigenous cultures that followed, and the eventual arrival of Euro-American settlers. Canyons and intricate rock formations are a stunning backdrop to the area's famously beautiful rock art, and the desert provides critical habitat for the threatened Mojave desert tortoise." \n\nThe area's cultural and archeological value is indisputable given its 12,000 years of human inhabitance, marked by ancient cooking sites, bones, tools, shelters, and spectacular art of the indigenous communities that inhabited the National Monument centuries and millennia ago, as well as historic sites of settlement by newer Western civilization. Even more ancient remnants of Jurassic period dinosaurs make the National Monument a compelling paleontological research site.  Its ecological value is similarly indisputable, given its designation as critical habitat for the threatened Mojave desert tortoise, as well as being home to a wide variety of reptile, mammal, bird, insect, and plant species, including many endemic species that grow only in this part of Nevada. Clearly, it is in the public interest to protect and preserve such objects of significant scientific and historic interest. \n\nSecretary Zinke is also directed to consider "that reservations of land not exceed the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management...". Given the broad ecological concerns for this land and the extensive historic, archeologic, and scientific sites spread across the National Monument, it would be shortsighted to attempt to draw more stringent boundaries that would undermine the protection afforded by the National Monument in its current borders.  \n\nExecutive Order #13792 further directs Secretary Zinke to review Monuments in part based on "concerns of State, tribal, and local governments affected by a designation, including the economic development and fiscal condition of affected States, tribes, and localities." It is notable that the senior US Senator from Nevada strongly supported the protection of Gold Butte, having stated "Is this worth preserving? Of course it is." The Senator's support of National Monument designation was in line with 71% of Nevada voters in a 2016 poll, according to PBS. Notwithstanding a small number of vocal and violent land-rights protestors, it is evident that an overwhelming majority of Nevada constituents support the continued protection of Gold Butte as a National Monument. Importantly, local Native tribes like the Moapa Band of Paiutes regard Gold Butte as sacred land. They support its National Monument designation as a protection of their cultural heritage and legacy.\n\nGiven the archeological, historical, scientific, and ecological importance of Gold Butte National Monument, the careful study that contributed to its establishment, and its overwhelming support by local Native people, politicians, and Nevada residents, its continued preservation should be an obvious choice. I strongly support the permanent protection of Gold Butte National Monument in the entirety of its current boundaries.	0	\N	\N	\N
762	DOI-2017-0002-0762	2017-05-12	Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument should be permanently maintained in its entirety as a National Monument due to its significant scientific, historical, cultural, ecological, and economic value to local Native American tribes, the local region, the state of Arizona, and the United States. \n\nExecutive Order #13792 directs Secretary Zinke to consider "whether designated lands are appropriately classified under the Act as "historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, or other objects of historic or scientific interest."" Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument is rich with ecological value: for example, a 2005 expedition of caves in the National Monument by a team from Northern Arizona University identified a genus of cave crickets never before seen on in nature (http://news.nau.edu/nau-researchers-chirping-over-discovery-of-new-cricket-genus/). Perhaps the most notable scientific value of Grand Canyon-Parashant lies in its geology, ranging from 500-million-year-old strata dating to the Cambrian period at the beginning of the Paleozoic era, to Triassic period formations less than half their age. Accompanying this incredible geologic spectacle are abundant fossil deposits of paleontological value.  Further archeologic value is found in sites of previous human habitation, which are preserved in uncommonly good condition in this remote location. The 2000 proclamation establishing the National Monument noted in particular "the irreplaceable rock art images, quarries, villages, watchtowers, agricultural features, burial sites, caves, rock shelters, trails, and camps" located throughout the area and dating from the Ancestral Puebloan Period to more recent Southern Paiute inhabitants (https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2001-title3-vol1/xml/CFR-2001-title3-vol1-proc7265.xml). Clearly, there are extensive "historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures...[and] other objects of historic or scientific interest" within the National Monument.\n\nSecretary Zinke is also directed to review Monuments in part based on "concerns of State, tribal, and local governments affected by a designation, including the economic development and fiscal condition of affected States, tribes, and localities." Is it any wonder that these ancestral lands are culturally and ecologically important to local Native Tribes such as the Havasupai, Navajo, and Hopi peoples, and that they have requested preservation of the lands surrounding the Grand Canyon region? It is also notable that Congressman Raul Grijalva of Arizona has introduced legislation to establish a larger National Monument to protect a greater area of this important geologic and archeologic area, sacred land, fragile ecosystem, and crucial watershed. In separate governmental action, new uranium mining claims have been banned in the area due to concerns about damaging local ecosystems, watersheds, and the fragile landscape of the area. \n\nProtecting the natural lands such as Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument that surround Grand Canyon National Park are also of important economic value to the local region, as they provide an important buffer to protect the immensely valuable National Park. The Grand Canyon is one of the Seven Wonders of the Natural World, an iconic image that defines the popular identity of the United States Southwest, and an incredibly popular tourism destination that received over 6 million visitors in 2016. In total, tourism to the Grand Canyon has a cumulative annual benefit to the local economy of over $800 million, providing approximately 9,000 jobs. The value of this space rests entirely on its preservation as an untouched, unspoiled landscape. Beyond its numerous intrinsic qualities, Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument provides a crucial buffer zone to protect the value of Grand Canyon National Park, and thus provides significant economic value to the surrounding area, the state of Arizona, and the United States as a whole. \n\nExecutive order #13792 furthermore directs Secretary Zinke to consider "that reservations of land not exceed the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management...". Given the broad ecological concerns for this land and the extensive historic, archeologic, and scientific sites spread across the National Monument, it would be shortsighted to attempt to draw more stringent boundaries that would undermine the protection afforded by the National Monument in its current borders. A large part of the value of the National Monument derives from its expansive, blanket protection of a broadly important area, and loss of any part would damage the whole. \n\nFor the significant scientific, historical, cultural, ecological, and economic value it provides, I strongly advocate for the continued protection of Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument in the entirety of its current borders.  	0	\N	\N	\N

768	DOI-2017-0002-0768	2017-05-12	My name is Mike Bush and I'm a resident of San Luis Obispo County, California, home of the Carizzo National Monument. I have lived in this county for six years, visiting the Monument every year -and camped this early April for a week with my wife. \n\nThe area is in a remote eastern portion of the county, with little population, although "dry farming" was important some decades ago, most has ceased at this point. However there are many small individual growing plots that are dotting the private land to the west edge of the Monument. It is easy to see how each site has to have its own access road, with regular deliveries, cutting up more and more of the fragile ecosystem. \n\nI can certainly see a time, should National Monument status be eliminated or reduced that this near-pristine valley along the San Andreas Fault, and lined with native rock drawings in the foothills would become a hap-hazard assortment of chemical-using and leachate providing tiny farms. \n\nThe largest user of the privately held land is large holdings of solar energy producers, who must further level the land to suit their needs and strip the vegetation. There are many, many places that solar panels can be installed - and inside National Monuments is far, far down the list. \n\nMake the correct assessment - that our Country and our citizens deserve to see and enjoy special places that remain a part of our National Heritage.	1	\N	\N	\N
769	DOI-2017-0002-0769	2017-05-12	Presidents have wide range to supersede each other on executive orders because the scope of those orders is limited to the executive branch that they are responsible for administrating. The impact of an Antiquities Act proclamation, of designating a protected national monument, is an act that affects the public. That goes beyond the day-to-day administration of the president's own executive branch. Limiting executive actions to the executive branch is an important limit to the powers and actions that a president can unilaterally take. Congress granted the power to designate a protected national monument in the Antiquities Act, but did not specify any authority to revoke or repeal that protection.\n\nFurther, another critical difference between executive orders and the proclamations made to protect public lands is that the day-to-day operations of federal agencies are, by comparison, changeable and repairable. If a president decides to change a directive in, for example, what duties the FCC prioritizes, a future president can undo or correct that action with relative ease. In contrast, if public lands are reduced and industry destroys that privatized land through mining or commercialization, that land has been lost to the public forever.\n\nThese lands are not property of the executive branch. They are the property of the public. Their protection was a promise to the public. The president may do what he wishes, within his legislative and constitutional boundaries, to manage the executive branch agencies that he is the administrator of. But he is not the administrator of these lands, he is their steward. In this duty, he is not a ruler, but a public servant.	0	\N	\N	\N

Bears Ears is a beautiful swath of canyons, mesas, and high desert that I visited recently and hope will remain preserved for generations to come in its current form. The original holders of the land through an Inter-Tribal Coalition worked with BLM and the Interior to ensure this monument would protect America's natural heritage as well as it's sacred tribal heritage. I additionally hope other monuments like Grand Staircase Escalante and also Grand Canyon are strengthened and preserved.

773	DOI-2017-0002-0773	2017-05-12	Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument should be permanently maintained in its entirety as a National Monument due to its significant scientific, historical, cultural, ecological, and economic value to local Native American tribes, the local region, the state of Utah, and the United States. \n\nExecutive order #13792 directs Secretary Zinke to review Monuments in part based on "concerns of State, tribal, and local governments affected by a designation, including the economic development and fiscal condition of affected States, tribes, and localities." Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument has not only the support of local Native tribes and conservation groups, but local business groups and the majority of Utahns as a whole. The Escalante Chamber of Commerce VP wrote an editorial recently (https://morningconsult.com/opinions/americas-national-monuments-contribute-economy-support-small-businesses/) "speak[ing] from firsthand experience about the positive impact national monuments have on our economy". Studies from Headwaters Economics corroborate his account (https://headwaterseconomics.org/dataviz/national-monuments/). \n\nSupport for the National Monument is not limited to the immediately surrounding communities. In a 2016 Pew poll (http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/assets/2016/08/3935-pew-utah-grand-staircaseescalante-topline-final.pdf), 98% of Utahns said protecting and conserving land for future generations was important to them. A majority said that designation of Grand Staircase-Escalante as a National Monument was a good thing for Utah in general, and even more so for Utah's tourism industry, its wildlife, and its environment. Almost 90% of Utahns indicated that they had used national public lands within the last year. The state of Utah notes that "The Grand Staircase-Escalante hiking scene is world class. It's fair to say the Escalante Canyons are the premier hiking destination in the region" (https://www.visitutah.com/places-to-go/most-visited-parks/grand-staircase-escalante/must-do). Utah also receives significant economic benefit from the 600,000 and 700,000 visitors the National Monument receives per year, who contributing $8.2 billion in tourism income and 142,500 jobs to the state as Utah tourism grows at record levels (http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865679687/Report-Utah-tourism-growing-at-record-levels.html). \n\nIt is notable that there are few if any downsides to the protection of the National Monument - for example, despite outcry by a minimal but vocal minority, the Utah Bureau of Land Management estimates that grazing on Monument land has seen "no clear trend in actual use levels and no evidence of "sharp" or "precipitous" declines in grazing on the Monument since designation" (https://eplanning.blm.gov/epl-front-office/projects/lup/69026/89840/107421/GSENM_GRAZING_EIS_FACT_SHEET_7-28-2015_(2).pdf). A coal company holding local leases was compensated fairly at the time of the monument's establishment. The rights of all affected parties have been properly considered for over two decades. Most stakeholders support continued protection of the National Monument.\n\nSecretary Zinke is also directed to consider "whether designated lands are appropriately classified under the Act as "historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, or other objects of historic or scientific interest."" Since the designation of the National Monument, approximately 20 new species of dinosaur have been discovered there (http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865601095/Dinosaur-discoveries-in-Utahs-amazing-place-get-national-attention.html). Over 300 different dinosaur species have been unearthed within Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. Such incredible archeologic richness is of obvious scientific and historical value, and deserves protection. The National Monument also provides valuable archeologic data about the Fremont and Anasazi indigenous peoples, who interacted with one another in the area and left a record of numerous prehistoric artifacts.\n\nWhile Secretary Zinke is instructed to consider "that reservations of land not exceed the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management," the archeologic, historic, and scientific value of this land demands its preservation in totality, as we cannot be sure exactly where the next priceless discovery might be found in the area. It is further noteworthy that the legality of the National Monument has already been upheld in federal court.\n\nGrand Staircase-Escalante National Monument is a national treasure, a beloved tourism destination, a stunningly beautiful landscape, and an archeological paradise. It would be foolish to reduce its protections in an attempt to trade fossils for fossil fuels. I wholeheartedly support the continued preservation of Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument and ask that the Trump administration consider its elevation to National Park status in recognition of its immense value to the American public. \n	0	\N	\N	\N

This country is its mountains, its nature, its monuments, it is not oil or corporate interests. Bears Ears is sacred to our Native American tribes who have time and time again been beaten down by our government. We should be leading the world in preserving these sacred sites and not being left behind as the rest of the world laughs at us for destroying our history. Australia and Canada both preserve their vast sites, we should be leading them to preserve more places and not show the world that we have no respect for our country by removing these beautiful places from being designated as national monuments. \n\nThe Antiquities Act allows the President of the United States to designate National Monuments and its purpose is to protect objects of historic and scientific interest. Places that are vital to maintaining the diversity and historic significance of our Country. One of the most culturally significant places protected by this act is Grand Canyon National Monument, designated as such under President Roosevelt. The Grand Canyon brings tourists from around the World and is one of the most recognized places in most of the World. It significantly provides for a tourism industry in Arizona and is vital for their economy. One of the greatest Presidents of our time realized we needed to preserve these areas in light of industry wanting to destroy the country. He turned our great outdoors into a tourism industry that is visited by millions from around the world. What is Montana without Glacier and Yellowstone and what is California without the Giant Redwoods and Sequoia National Park? Nothing. Those places define our country. \n\nBears Ears is one of the places that defines Utah. I have always wanted to visit there, rent an RV, and go camping with my family. It is a place that needs to be preserved for future generations. \n\nI call on you, as a fellow Montanan, please preserve these areas.

780	DOI-2017-0002-0780	2017-05-12	I grew up in San Juan County, and my family still lives there. I feel deeply connected to the beautiful land that is there, and I want it to be preserved for generations to come. However, I have personally witnessed the impact that federal monument designations have. Rather than protecting the land, the designations spotlight it for tourists who often do not appreciate it enough to care for it. Tourism is a major destructive force.\n\nThat being said, my main opposition is on behalf of my native brothers and sisters who still live on the land and are completely dependent on it for their lives. Many of these people continue to live without indoor plumbing and heating. Under the rules of the monument, they can only gather enough wood that they can carry and must do so without the use of motorized vehicles. How on earth are they supposed to do that?!? It is sometimes many miles between an area with enough vegetation that can be rationally harvested for wood burning stoves. And it takes much more than one person can gather by hand to keep a home warm in the frigid winters. Further, these people use the land for their sheep and other livestock. What will happen to them and the animals that they use to survive when their wells dry up, and they can't drill new ones? Or how about when they aren't allowed to farm where they have always farmed? The Bears Ears monument and its lack of native governance is one more major slap in the face to our native population. If this monument stands, it will leave another trail of tears as the people are forced to leave like they have been throughout our country's history. \n\nRespectfully, I ask President Trump to undo this monument designation and allow the government to enforce the laws that are already in place to protect my amazing home and the people that live there. 	0	\N	\N	\N

Hanford Reach was targeted for protection half a century before it became a National Monument. The federal government bought this land during World War II for the Manhattan Project and made it a buffer zone for nuclear activities. The historic legacy of the Manhattan Project in this space is obvious and provides an important reminder of the environmental and societal impact of nuclear weapons development. \n\nBeautiful and dramatically empty, Hanford Reach is the largest area of intact shrub-steppe habitat in the region, providing critical habitat for many rare and endangered flora and fauna including two plant and 40 insect species first discovered there. Local nuclear activity also prevented the damming of this portion of the mighty Columbia River, leaving it the last free-flowing stretch and the most valuable salmon spawning area on the entire river. 80% of the Columbia's remaining wild fall Chinook salmon spawn there, making it a cornerstone of the Pacific Northwest fishing industry. The National Monument also provides wintering habitat for bald eagles, white pelicans, and numerous waterfowl as well as year-round habitat for peregrine falcons and many steppe and shrub-steppe dependent species. \n\nHanford Reach National Monument contains over 150 archeological sites that hold the history of its indigenous peoples, spanning 10,000 years of local habitation. Early pioneer settlements have also been preserved, as well as a stark view of the no-longer-active nuclear reactors across the Columbia River, marking the area's more modern history. This historic and ecologic identity provides clear "historic or scientific interest."\n\nExecutive order #13792 also directs Secretary Zinke to review Monuments in part based on "concerns of State, tribal, and local governments affected by a designation, including the economic development and fiscal condition of affected States, tribes, and localities." Hanford Reach National Monument lies on the ancestral lands of the Wanapum, Yakama, Colville, Umatilla, and Nez Perce Native tribes. A Yakama tribal council member stated his tribe's support for the National Monument and noted that its preservation is important for fisheries (https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/news/hanford-reach-declared-a-national-monument/). Hanford Reach also received staunch support from US Senator Patty Murray, who requested its National Monument status from the Clinton administration in the 1990s and defended that National Monument status on the Senate floor (https://www.murray.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2001/7/murray-helps-prevent-oil-and-gas-drilling-in-the-hanford-reach-national-monument), stating that "We knew what we were doing by the designation. We knew we were choosing to protect unique and vital habitats. We knew we were honoring important cultural sites. We intended to leave this legacy to future generations." It would be deeply dishonest for the federal government to rescind that promise to the American public by decades later selling off the special land it promised to protect forever. In Senator Murray's words: "Is nothing sacred anymore?"\n\nHanford Reach National Monument supports the economies of its surrounding communities, too. Headwaters Economics reported in 2008 that during the eight years following President Clinton's proclamation, the Hanford Reach region gained over 25,000 jobs while real per capita income grew by 7%. The travel and tourism industry provided 13,750 jobs and 14% of total private employment in the area.\n \nSecretary Zinke is further directed to consider "that reservations of land not exceed the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management...". Given the historic role of Hanford Reach as a buffer zone for the Hanford nuclear area, the ecologic and archeologic importance of the entire National Monument, and the economic importance of protecting this area of the Columbia River, the National Monument should be fully preserved in its currently drawn borders. President Clinton exhibits the extensive research that went into his establishment of the National Monument in the text of Proclamation 7319 (http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=62329), indicating that the above concerns were contemplated thoroughly prior to the National Monument's creation. \n\nPermanent protection of Hanford Reach is necessary in order to protect its substantial ecologic, historical, scientific, economic, and cultural value.\n	0	\N	\N	\N

Ironwood Forest National Monument contains the highest species richness in the entire Sonoran Desert, including a number of endangered or threatened species. Ecologically, it is a crown jewel that demands conservation. Extensive rock art and archeological sites throughout the National Monument provide further scientific and historic interest, including multiple areas that are listed on the National Register of Historic Places due to their archeological value. \n\nExecutive order #13792 also directs Secretary Zinke to review Monuments in part based on "the economic development and fiscal condition of affected States, tribes, and localities." 19% of private employment in Pima County derives from the travel and tourism industry, with outdoor recreation contributing over $5 billion annually to the Arizona economy. As a large outdoor recreation area located conveniently between Tucson and Phoenix, Ironwood Forest National Monument is an important cornerstone of this tourism economy.\n\nSecretary Zinke is further directed to consider "that reservations of land not exceed the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management...". Secretary Clinton's Proclamation 7320 (http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=62320) makes clear the careful consideration that supported his decision to preserve Ironwood Forest as a National Monument. Almost two decades later, the rationale for preserving the ecologic and archeologic treasures of Ironwood Forest is still plain to see. Given the immense ecologic and archeological value of this fragile landscape, any acre of industrial development would come at an extremely high cost. \n\nIronwood Forest National Monument is a national treasure that demands permanent protection in its entirety. I firmly oppose any action to remove its status or diminish its acreage.	0	\N	\N	\N
784	DOI-2017-0002-0784	2017-05-12	I would like to object to any review of the status of the current national monuments. Such a motion is obviously based in the  extreme right-wing, pro-development, pro-oligarchy, and paranoid anti-"globalism" sentiments held by a small marginal insider cabal of Trump advisors, and as such does not reflect the beliefs of most Americans. I am intimately familiar with the Giant Sequoia National Monument and the Carrizo Plain National Monument as exemplars of our national natural patrimony that should be preserved from exploitation for all Americans, for all time. The forces for exploitation and development are always present and always looking for opportunity--only by countering those forces with preservation in perpetuity of these exemplar national natural treasures can their future be assured. 	0	\N	\N	\N
785	DOI-2017-0002-0785	2017-05-12	I oppose the Department of the Interior's "Review of Certain National Monuments Established Since 1996." \nThe establishment of the National Monuments under review has protected sites of important scenic, conservation, recreational, and historical value. This review process appears to be an attempt to strip the protections provided by National Monument status with a goal to transfer these lands to private interests for development of these lands: to mine them for minerals, possibly to construct luxury vacation accommodations accessible to only the wealthy, opening the lands for grazing that is not properly managed, or other damaging forms of land use and development. \n\nPresident Trump declared, "The Antiquities Act does not give the federal government unlimited power to lock up millions of acres of land and water, and it's time that we ended this abusive practice."\nIn the United States, the government is the people and federal lands belong to the people -- all of the people. Lands are not "locked up" when they belong to everyone, and it is not an abusive practice to preserve and protect important American lands. \n\nI strongly oppose the idea that state governors and those living near National Monuments should have the ultimate say over how the land is managed. Lands that are culturally valuable, have immense scenic value, are historically meaningful, require permanent ecological protection and preservation, are important for recreational uses -- these lands must be preserved for the present and the future and, in many cases, protected and preserved for the non-human species that depend on those lands.\n\nI believe that the concept of "limited government" is an expression used to decrease protection of American lands and give those valuable public lands to private interests that seek to exploit those lands for private profit. Exploitation of protected lands can lead to damage and destruction of land value, and privatization takes public land and gives it to private interests, thereby locking it away from the public. Privatization can destroy recreational value. Exploitation and privatization can destroy historical, ecological, and scenic value. \n\nOur nation does not cry out for limited government in relation to its military, so why do we need limited government in other areas of concern? Cries of "limited government" are only heard when a private interest's goals to generate private wealth are frustrated. The concept of limited government is only expressed by those whose plans are thwarted when the people of the United States, through the powers of the federal government, preserve national resources using laws written for that very purpose. \n\nSome of the monuments under review are located in California. I very strongly oppose the review of all California National Monuments: Giant Sequoia, Carrizo Plain, San Gabriel Mountains, Berryessa Snow Mountain, Mojave Trails, and Sand to Snow.\n	0	\N	\N	\N

Connecting Joshua Tree National Park to the Mojave National Preserve, Mojave Trails National Monument plays an important role as a wildlife corridor for species such as the desert bighorn sheep and desert tortoise, while containing a diverse array of life in and of itself. Alongside 12 adjacent public land areas, Mojave Trails National Monument is a significant part of the second largest desert preserve on the globe. Each of these public land components is thus important to the protection of the whole. Meanwhile, the landscape provides a stunning experience for tourists passing through. Mojave Trails is geologically significant, containing cinder cone volcanoes and multiple mountain ranges that stand stark against the desert landscape, in addition to fossil beds containing half-billion-year-old trilobites. The Pisgah Lava Flow in particular is a leading location for research on the effects of volcanic activity on evolution. Mojave Trails also contains unique cultural and archeological sites such as indigenous trade routes and trails. Throughout this landscape in the National Monument winds an authentic and undeveloped stretch of historic Route 66. Put simply, this landscape is the American Southwest at its best.\n\nSecretary Zinke is also instructed to review Monuments in part based on "concerns of State, tribal, and local governments affected by a designation, including the economic development and fiscal condition of affected States, tribes, and localities." The Ward Valley region of the National Monument is sacred to the Colorado River Indian Tribes. A quarter of a million acres of the monument were donated by the Wildlife Conservancy for the express purpose of federal protection, the largest private land gift in the history of the United States. These stakeholders deserve priority consideration in the monument's future. The longtime support of US Senator Dianne Feinstein is also notable, from the elevation of nearby Death Valley and Joshua Tree National Monuments to National Parks in the mid-1990s to requesting that President Obama's preserve Mojave Trails. \n\nThe president of KEEN stated recently that Mojave Trails is "exactly the kind of place the Antiquities Act intended to protect. It is rich in cultural history, archeological sites, and recreation opportunities...that benefit all Americans." 3.2 million people visit the public lands surrounding Mojave Trails annually, providing 2,700 jobs and $200 million to the local economy. The preservation of Mojave Trails National Monument in the center it all will support further tourism growth in the area: a local resort employee writes that such National Monuments are "a boon to our local economies and emblems of our local heritage" (http://www.sbsun.com/opinion/20170510/efforts-to-shrink-eliminate-national-monuments-will-hurt-economy-guest-commentary). An entrepreneur and a venture capitalist note the importance of public lands for attracting top-notch talent and point out a recent study showing "that communities in the American West have $4.360 higher per capita income for every 100,000 acres of protected public lands," Donald Trump Jr., who stated that our public lands are "about being able to get in there and enjoy the outdoors and enjoy those great traditions that are...so much the foundation of America...and making sure that those lands are maintained properly; making sure they're not going into private hands to be effectively walled off to the general public" (http://www.mercurynews.com/2016/12/28/opinion-national-monuments-drive-economic-growth/). \n\nSecretary Zinke is further directed to consider "that reservations of land not exceed the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management...". As Mojave Trails is the keystone of the California desert's protected lands, no acreage can be sacrificed without adverse consequences. President Obama's 2016 proclamation to establish the National Monument (https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/02/12/presidential-proclamation-establishment-mojave-trails-national-monument) makes clear the extensive research underlying the decision to protect this land and the value lying in every acre.\n\nMojave Trails National Monument is a place of stunning beauty, a site of archeological, ecological, and geological significance, and an indispensable component of the California desert public lands. It must be permanently protected in its entirety. 	0	\N	\N	\N
790	DOI-2017-0002-0790	2017-05-12	I oppose this review.  I am proud of the tradition of U.S. Presidents upgrading the level of protection for existing public lands.  These actions have never been random or capricious.  National Monument status is awarded after extensive study of potential impacts and consideration of public commentary.  On the other hand, this Executive Order is extremely arbitrary in that it targets the legacies of our last three Presidents, and there seems no reason that if these decades are brought into question, then every National Monument is at risk.  This is not the will of the American people.\n\nThe Executive Order questions the size of National Monuments, but science is clear that when ecosystem protection is the goal, bigger reserves protect biodiversity, smaller ones don't.  Equally, there are uses that are compatible with conservation and others that are not, so multiple-use policies should not mean "any use" policies.  We already have laws and policies in place to deal with non-federal lands within federal land boundaries.  Inholdings have established rights, and they should also have appropriate restrictions.  The Executive Order calls for consideration of impacts on and uses of lands beyond Monument boundaries, already accomplished prior to the designation.  In fact, economic research clearly shows that communities associated with public lands that have been upgraded to National Monuments can expect a sustainable boost in local economic vitality as a result of an increase in recreational visitors.  The concern about the cost of management to our federal budget is one that could be leveled at any federal agency, including Congress and the Presidency.  American taxpayers overwhelmingly consider the National Park Service to be one of the best agencies that our taxes support. Not so much, Washington, D.C.  \n\nI understand that the Department of Interior must comply with the President's Executive Order to conduct this review.  However, there is no reason to ignore the decades of public advocacy that led to each National Monument.  There is good reason to uphold the century of Presidential designations, that represent the voices of U.S. citizens, along with state, county, tribal, and other local entities that have nominated worthy public lands for National Monument status.  I am deeply disappointed that a President who ran for office on the platform "Make America Great Again" seems intent on putting at risk every one of our national treasures that has National Monument status, instead of adding to that legacy.\n\nI do not think that the Department of Interior has the right to second-guess the actions of our past Presidents.  Please uphold your public trust.  Your report in response to the Executive Order should oppose the assumption that there is any need to reconsider our National Monuments.\n\nAs a fiscally-conservative taxpayer, I oppose any action to remove or reduce an existing National Monument status, because this will surely result in lawsuits.  Righteous lawsuits, that the Department of Interior is very likely to lose, but only after outrageous legal expenses.  I am very angry to think that my taxes might be used to defend an action that is an anathema to the vast majority of Americans.  I will personally donate every dollar I can afford to legally oppose this attack on our National Monuments, if it comes to that.  Please do everything you can to prevent this travesty.\n	0	\N	\N	\N

793	DOI-2017-0002-0793	2017-05-12	Sonoran Desert National Monument should be permanently maintained in its entirety as a National Monument due to its significant economic, cultural, archeological, and ecological value to its region, the State of Arizona, and the United States of America as a whole.  Opening this desert to grazing, mining or drilling would cause irreparable harm and should not be allowed.\n\nThe Sonoran desert is the most complex in North America, with a bi-seasonal rain pattern and occasional snow. As a result, the it has among the largest species richness of any desert worldwide. A surprising variety of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and arthropods inhabit this desert, which is also the only place in the world where the saguaro cactus grows. Among the native inhabitants of Sonoran Desert National Monument are the Mexican gray wolf and jaguar, both endangered species. Habitat loss is a leading threat to these large predators, as they require large contiguous territories to survive. Land uses such as mining, drilling, or grazing that would reduce their habitat could mean local extinction of these species and the disruption of the entire food chain beneath them. These large predators keep populations of vermin and pests, as well as their larger prey, under control, benefiting the surrounding human population. Similarly, the lesser long-nosed bat is a major pollinator for cacti and agave throughout the Sonoran Desert, and therefore plays a vital role in the biodiversity of the desert ecosystem. 25,000 acres of the Maricopa Mountains area of the National Monument is also designated as "critical habitat" for the Sonoran Desert tortoise. \n\nExecutive Order #13792 directs Secretary Zinke to consider "that reservations of land not exceed the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management...". The significant ecological concerns listed above demand the greatest preservation possible, and would suffer as a result of any acre of land lost from the National Monument. In fact, the National Monument should be extended in order to better protect this precious and fragile ecosystem. President Clinton's proclamation (https://www.blm.gov/nlcs_web/sites/style/medialib/blm/az/images/son_des.Par.30940.File.dat/proclamation.pdf) specifically stated that "To extend the extraordinary diversity and overall ecological health of the Sand Tanks Mountains area, land adjacent and with biological resources similar to the area withdrawn for military purposes should be subject to a similar management regime to the fullest extent possible."\n \nExecutive Order #13792 further directs Secretary Zinke to review Monuments based on "whether designated lands are appropriately classified under the act as 'historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, [or] other objects of historic and scientific interest.'"  The Sonoran desert has been inhabited for 7500 years, and hundreds of miles of prehistoric irrigation canals for agriculture have been discovered in the Gila River Valley. President Clinton's 2001 proclamation specifically cites the Vekol Wash travel and trade corridor, "many signs of large villages and permanent habitat sites" scattered "throughout the area" that were inhabited by the ancestors of current Native tribes in the area, as well as a well-used 23-mile-long trail corridor and "rock art sites, lithic quarries, and scattered artifacts." These historic landmarks, structures, and archeologic sites are of significant cultural and scientific interest and require continued preservation.\n\nToday, several local Native tribes have ancestral links to ancient indigenous people living within the National Monument, including the Quechan, Cocopah, O'odham, and Maricopa tribes. Their traditions, together with on-going archeology and the continued interest of visitors, combine to protect the cultural legacy of the Sonoran Desert. Clearly this is an area of historic and scientific interest, as well as a significant basis for tourism in the area.  It should not be opened to grazing, mining or drilling, which would permanently destroy the unique history, features, and cultural benefits of this landscape.\n\nA 2016 Colorado State study of America's National Park System "demonstrates that more than half of the total economic value of national parks is attributable to the benefits the American public receives from just knowing the National Park System is protected for current and future generations." Given the architectural, historical, cultural, and environmental significance of the Sonoran Desert National Monument, that principle clearly applies in this case, and the National Monument should continue to be permanently protected in its entirety.  The Sonoran Desert is a National Monument for good reason, and it is our responsibility to preserve it.	0	\N	\N	\N
794	DOI-2017-0002-0794	2017-05-12	Marianas Trench National Monument should be permanently maintained in the entirety of its current borders as a National Monument due to its significant ecologic, scientific, and economic value to the United States. \n\nExecutive Order #13792 directs Secretary Zinke to consider "whether designated lands are appropriately classified under the Act as 'historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, or other objects of historic or scientific interest.'" Marianas Trench National Monument encompasses an area with unique geological resources, including the only known location of molten sulfur in the world and one of only two known sites in the world that produce pure liquid carbon dioxide. These locations present distinctive opportunities for scientific study, such as the life forms that exist in these rare and extremely harsh conditions. Further, Marianas Trench comprises irreplaceable reef ecosystems with high degrees of valuable biodiversity.\n\nExecutive order #13792 also directs Secretary Zinke to review Monuments in part based on "concerns of State, tribal, and local governments affected by a designation, including the economic development and fiscal condition of affected States, tribes, and localities." The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands finds that the Marianas Trench National Monument presents "significant opportunities" for the tourism industry as well as environmental protection efforts. (http://www.frbsf.org/community-development/files/CNMI-StrategicPlan2009-2014.pdf) Corroborating this claim, an economic impact study of the Marianas Trench National Monument estimates that increased tourism to the region generate an "excess of $10 million in spending, over $14 million in sales, $5 million in tax revenues, and 400 jobs."  (http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/legacy/uploadedfiles/peg/publications/report/economic20impact20mariana20trenchpdf.pdf) \n\nAccording to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, GDP for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, which encompasses the Marianas Trench National Monument, has increased every year since the National Monument designation, with the exception of 2011. Tourism accounts for a substantial portion of this increase, with tourist spending on accommodations, amusement, and services mirroring the trend of overall GDP. Further, employees receive higher compensation for the tourism industry than for any other singular private industry operating in the Commonwealth (https://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/general/terr/2016/CNMIGDP_112916.pdf). \n\nGiven the aforementioned considerations, I wholeheartedly support the continued and permanent protection of the Marianas Trench National Monument in the entirety of its currently drawn borders. Permanent protection of Marianas Trench is an absolute necessity to protect the substantial ecologic, scientific, and economic value it provides to the United States. 	0	\N	\N	\N
795	DOI-2017-0002-0795	2017-05-12	Papahanaumokuakea National Monument should be permanently maintained in the entirety of its current borders as a National Monument due to its significant ecologic, scientific, historical, and cultural value to the United States. \n\nExecutive Order #13792 directs Secretary Zinke to consider "whether designated lands are appropriately classified under the Act as 'historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, or other objects of historic or scientific interest.'" Papahanaumokuakea meets these criteria in multiple ways. Firstly, the historic Battle of Midway took place within the Papahanaumokuakea protected area. The Battle of Midway was a pivotal battle in the Pacific Theater of World War II, as the United States defeated Japan in a decisive naval confrontation that paved the way for eventual victory. The sunken remains of aircraft and battleships in the area continue to provide historians with invaluable information about the battle.\n\nSecondly, Papahanaumokuakea is culturally significant to the Hawaiian people. Native Hawaiians consider Papahanaumokuakea to be the spiritual birthplace and home of their people, with a high concentration of sacred sites. In fact, UNESCO declared Papahanaumokuakea a World Heritage Site in 2010 due to its natural and cultural significance. UNESCO describes its sacred sites as "of outstanding significance," providing "a profound understanding" of ancient Polynesian culture. Archaeological sites on Papahanaumokuakea provide valuable insights into pre-European settlement in this area.\n\nFinally, the unique geomorphological history and high degree of isolation in Papahanaumokuakea have resulted in what UNESCO calls an "extremely high degree of endemism." (http://www.papahanaumokuakea.gov/pdf/whc10_34com_20.pdf) Papahanaumokuakea contains over 1,000 endemic species that are not found anywhere else in the world, and are vital to the health and diversity of the marine ecosystem. The extensive coral reefs located in Papahanaumokuakea serve as home to numerous endangered species. It is critical to maintain protection of the entirety of Papahanaumokuakea National Monument to avoid disrupting these delicate ecosystems, sacred sites, and historical landmarks.\n\nGiven the aforementioned considerations, I wholeheartedly support the continued and permanent protection of Papahanaumokuakea National Monument in the entirety of its currently drawn borders. Permanent protection of Papahanaumokuakea is necessary in order to protect the substantial ecologic, scientific, historical, and cultural value it provides to the United States and the world.	0	\N	\N	\N

801	DOI-2017-0002-0801	2017-05-12	I am writing to express my desire that all national monuments under review retain their status as national monuments. I can speak most clearly on the California parks. I am in the San Gabriel Monument nearly weekly now, as I train to hike Mount Whitney this summer. Although I am in the wilderness, I'm almost never alone. This amazing natural space is a popular draw to nearby urbanites and to those training for trekking in faraway both, so I am sure it boosts businesses all along the San Gabriel Valley. I've also visited the Sequoia monument many times. The trees speak for themselves-they are magnificent, a national treasure that should be fiercely preserved. I can't imagine a future where I don't take my children to visit the Sequoias. Do not even begin to think that the nearby National Park contains "enough" Sequoias. There is no such thing--we should protect all of them. \n\nAlthough these two monuments are near and dear to my heart, I know it is mostly my proximity and familiarity to them that makes them in my mind the best--all our natural wonders across the nation should be saved so that generations of Americans can find what I have found in them: recreation, friendship, peace, majesty, and awe at our great nation. \n\nI am willing to pay a great deal more in taxes to protect our National lands (I'm also willing to pay more in gas), and as a Californian, I am more than happy to forgo watering my lawn to preserve the dessert spaces. They are worth infinitely more to me as they are than as developed mining operations, water sites or oil fields. 	0	\N	\N	\N

803	DOI-2017-0002-0803	2017-05-12	The National Monuments are jewels in the public trust.  When I was a child growing up in Oregon, my family would take road trips to Craters of the Moon, the Sonoran Desert, the Escalante Grand Staircase, Sequoia, and so many others--we would join multitudes of travelers learning of the geological, archeological, botanical and wildlife treasures that make our country a place of great beauty and inspiration.  These trips left an indelible impression on me as a child, and led to my avocation as a plant scientist.  The monuments are treasures not only because of their beauty, but because they tell us that life can endure through tough challenges, that God's handiwork is all around us, and that we have a role as stewards of God's creation.  No pile of coal, gallon of oil, or shred of minerals comes close in value to the lessons we can learn from these places in their intact and unexploited state.   It is our charge to protect these monuments for future generations.  We will be judged by our grandchildren and their grandchildren, not based on how many millions of dollars the wealthy few among us make by destroying our national heritage, but by how many millions of children have the chance over the years to come to explore and learn from them.  These are places protected by the antiquities act.  Not by corporate ledger, but by a will to protect our countries ancient landscapes and their biota in perpetuity.  Do not violate this trust.  Do not open these landscapes up to private exploitation.  Do not sell our national heritage to the highest bidder.   Presidents from both parties and over generations have honored, valued and set aside these monuments for future generations. We should honor their judgement, not play God, not have the hubris to presume we know better.

Bears Ears is exactly the kind of place the Antiquities Act intended to protect. It is rich in cultural history which inspired a historic coalition of tribes to band together to push for its designation. In addition to protecting over 100,000 archaeological sites, the designation preserves world-class recreation opportunities in places like Cedar Mesa, Grand Gulch, and Indian Creek.\n\nThe process that led to the designation of Bears Ears National Monument was thorough and transparent. For more than 80 years, decision makers from all sides presented proposals seeking permanent protection of all or part of this incredible landscape. The boundaries were informed by both the multi-year Public Lands Initiative and by a proposal from the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition. Those boundaries do not exceed the acreage necessary to preserve the rich cultural heritage, ecological values, and recreation assets.\n\nThank you for reviewing the decades of hard work and thoughtful consideration that culminated in the designation of Bears Ears National Monument. Please recommend that President Trump leave the current Bears Ears National Monument boundaries in place.	0	\N	\N	\N

People forget now that one hundred years ago there were public men of good character who advocated the nation selling its public lands in great quantities, so that the nation could get the most money out of it, and giving it to the men who could cultivate it for their own uses. We took the proper democratic ground that the land should be granted in small sections to the men who were actually to till it and live on it. Now, with the water power, with the forests, with the mines, we are brought face to face with the fact that there are many people who will go with us in conserving the resources only if they are to be allowed to exploit them for their benefit. That is one of the fundamental reasons why the special interests should be driven out of politics. Of all the questions which can come before this nation, short of the actual preservation of its existence in a great war, there is none which compares in importance with the great central task of leaving this land even a better land for our descendants than it is for us, and training them into a better race to inhabit the land and pass it on. Conservation is a great moral issue, for it involves the patriotic duty of insuring the safety and continuance of the nation. Let me add that the health and vitality of our people are at least as well worth conserving as their forests, waters, lands, and minerals, and in this great work the national government must bear a most important part."\n\nThese words are as true today as they were then.  We should protect our current public lands (and add new ones) for our future generations, just as our predecessors did before us.	0	\N	\N	\N
820	DOI-2017-0002-0820	2017-05-12	Good Morning, \n\nI am writing in SUPPORT of Bears Ears National Monument. I have spent many years of my life in the deserts and canyons of Utah, both personally and professionally. The Bears Ears National Monument area is some of most spectacular, wild and untouched remaining anywhere in the US and we should not be diminishing its size or scope in any way. This area, between the Colorado and San Juan rivers, has some of the best remnants of our ancient cultures which we should be preserving for generations to come. \n\nI have seen first hand the difference that protection can make for these artifacts. In places that are not protected I have seen where people have chiseled petroglyphs and pictographs out of the rock to take home as "art", and I have seen places where cairns and ancestral dwellings have been dismantled for souvenirs. I have also seen the destruction that comes to these delicate areas when road building and oil rigs are allowed to work the land. I do not wish to have my view of the stars obscured by the lights of a drill rig, or to breath the dust of heavy trucks that cut across the desert. Too many place in the deserts of Utah already know this pollution.  \n\nI have also seen where careful curation of these cultural artifacts yields greater understanding of our history and opens the imagination of our children. As a professional guide in this area, my job depended on being able to show people unique and beautiful places. Having a national monument to preserve this area would be job security for me.  Please DO NOT change this monument designation. \n\nThanks you\n\nMary Engels	0	\N	\N	\N

822	DOI-2017-0002-0822	2017-05-12	In the U.S. by the time a National Monument has been established, public input and governmental and private review has occurred for many years. Meanwhile, the oil and gas exploration and production that consumes millions of acres throughout our nation is under far less review, with little public input. Specifically, the Bears Ears National Monument in SE Utah is an incredible area and it was established with the intention of ensuring tribal expertise and knowledge is preserved with its preservation. The tribal people of this country are owed much more than this, but this is a start. In the state of Utah, we are experiencing record numbers of tourism with billions of dollars spent as people come to visit the National Parks or recreate throughout our beautiful landscape. And yet, our elected officials in Utah ignore the wishes of their constituents and fail to "connect the dots" in terms of what landscape protection, monuments, and tourism mean for our economy and instead focus on providing favors and decreasing regulations for the oil and gas industry. We must create more National Monuments, keep the ones we have designated, and focus on protecting and healing the open land that remains.\n \n \n\n	0	\N	\N	\N

The protection of these parks benefits not just the residents in proximity but the nation as a whole.  These are landscapes that have molded the American character and sit deep in our spirits, and thus it is a patriotic plea to wish to safeguard the value of the lands.

In the words of Theodore Roosevelt, "I believe that the natural resources must be used for the benefit of all our people, and not monopolized for the benefit of the few."

This Administrative Order is arbitrary in its use of January 1, 1996 as a cutoff date for National Monument designation review. If it is to be reasoned and democratic, it should review all National Monument designations, including the original designation of Grand Canyon National Monument, which is much larger than many of the National Monuments under review by this order. The criteria for review of the post-1996 National Monuments should be applied to all monuments otherwise the review is arbitrary in its focus. It is also arbitrary because it singles out a period of time where the vast majority of the National Monuments were designated by Presidents of the Democratic Party. This singles out Monument designations by the political party often opposed to President Trump's Republican Party. Therefore, the cutoff date is also politically motivated. For these reasons, Executive Orders 13792 and 13795 must either be rescinded or its temporal scope should expand to cover all past National Monument designations since the Antiquities Act was enacted on June 8, 1906. 	0	\N	\N	\N

National monuments bring people of all ethnicities and ages together to admire nature in its beauty. This,monuments are special to us because it gives us the opportunity to see a source of nature we wouldn't see in our everyday lives. You get the chance to meet people all over the world because we all have  one thing in common when we come the national monuments. This isn't back home where I live and I get to experience and admire what the United States of America has to offer. By destroying and not funding this monuments what has America become. It's like destroying mount Rushmore it's the same exact thing since mount Rushmore was built in a magnificent mountain in a landmark where one person saw what it can do for us. National moments bring people together. Just walk into one of these monuments and you would see the power it does to people. People go there to admire nature at its finest but then at the same time admire america. The United States of America is not only known for its famous cities Los angeles, new york, Dallas, chicago, Washington dc, Seattle but for its beutiful national monuments we have to offer. People come all over the world to admire this landscapes the grand canyon, joshua tree, death valley. All this may just be a source of nature but they all offer a different kind of experience. The grand canyon for its rock formations, death valley or its night sky and joshua tree for its dessert in California that offers unique rock formations unlike anywhere in the world.

838	DOI-2017-0002-0838	2017-05-12	I fully support keeping ALL of these National Monuments, without any reduction of size.  These lands now belong to the American people and are priceless in their historical and natural value.  When my husband and I travel, we make a point to visit any local National Parks or National Monuments or National Historic Sites in the area,  because we value and treasure our American heritage and know that the visit will be wothwhile.  \n\nRegarding Bears Ears National Monument, it is my understanding that much of the land had previously been owned by the federal government anyway as National Forest and that the land has historical and culural value to several local Native American peoples.  Thus, in my opinion, it is reasonable to be made into a National Monument for its historic and cultural traditions.  I look forward to visiting the area in the future.\n\nRegarding Katahdin Woods, it is my understanding that a wealthy family purchased the land parcels over several years with an intent to donate the lands to the federal government for public use.  I am aware that there have been other instances in the past where wealthy people have acquired land with a goal to preserve it for for the American people, and ordinary citizens such as myself donate funds to nonprofit groups with the intent to preserve and protect and enhance land for public use.  Perhaps some people in the area don't like that the Katahdin Woods were donated to the American people, but clearly the private landowner family was completely within their rights to DONATE their land which they had purchased. Plus, they also donated funds to accompany their land donation!  In my opinion, we as an American people should be grateful to citizens who use their wealth to make our nation better.  As a country we have a proud tradition of private citizens donating to hospitals and parks and schools, etc.\n\nRegarding the marine Monuments,  I had to read to learn more.

848	DOI-2017-0002-0848	2017-05-12	 Mr Zinke,\nI am a resident that has resided in Monument Valley Utah for approximately 23 years. My story is a bit different than most. I am not a teacher (Outside of my home) I do not work at the clinic and I do not live in the public housing for Non Native people working in the area. I am actually married into a Navajo Family and have ten Navajo kids. My life has not been any different that that of any of the locals. I have lived without running water and electricity. I struggled for many years to buy my kids second hand shoes. My husband and I peddled our art all across the country. Traded for gas, food, and many times we have traded for Christmas. We lived the barter system. So here I am a Montana girl in the middle of the Navajo Nation! I did not realize back then how uncommon that was until after the fact. I used to think the world was perfect even with all it's imperfections I believed in humanity and the equality we all share. My thinking has changed some over the years I realized there is such thing as discrimination. My life on the Navajo Nation is beautiful but it has not been 100% rosy. It took a long time to adapt not so much for me but for the people even close family members who I woudl ever trade now were not thrilled at the aspect I moved in.  Years later I actually feel like I was born in the wrong skin. Maybe it is the army brat in me but I seem to have adapted quite well to the lifestyle and feel homesick for Monument Valley when I am in Montana visiting family! How does that happen! Montana is an extraordinary place as well. I am a lucky girl to have been able to live the life I have that is for sure! \nI want to share with you some of my biggest concerns. I could share a lot of them with you but I know you know first hand many of the concerns on both sides already.\nMy concerns are with the Navajo people. I know you have learned a little about the Utah Navajo versus the AZ Navajo and so on because you mentioned it. Well the Utah Navajo's for years have utilized the lands for firewood, herbs, as well as pinion picking, hunting,  The utilization of these lands has been both for personal use as well as commercial use. Not every Navajo in Utah has a truck or the means to gather wood. Not every Navajo in the winter has a job or a way to provide for their families. Not every Navajo Collects herbs for ceremonies or dyes for rugs, nor the basket weaving willows. I don't know the english name for this plant so I will call it willows. Arrow makers sell their arrows to provide for their families as well. Just like our medicine Native medicine is not free. What happens when our herbalist sells these plants at the local flea market or sells them during a ceremony to treat their patients? (Not every Navajo is qualified to gather herbs for ceremonies or medicine. ceremonies are only conducted by ordained medicine men who have studied the ways or the ways have been passed down to them)  that is another commerce on the Navajo Nation. This a real problem. I have watched the news and have seen people imprisoned for misuse of public lands. The thing is it is not a matter of if this will happen I guarantee you it will. It is a way of life it is not an easy life either. Then there is the collection of Hogan wood and the passing of money to either gather it for homes or to build these homes. This is a huge issue and potentially this Monument can end the way of life as it has been known for as long as the Navajo People have resided in the four corners. \nThe third problem is the fact that San Juan County is a small county that will be left divided. by Navajo and Non Navajo. Or Native and non native. So sad!\nMr Zinke I know what it is like to stand up in a meeting and be told to be quiet because I have the wrong color of skin. I have felt division and know this will not be an impartial board over Bears ears Monument.  I can handle division, but I do not want my neighbors off the reservation to feel that division. (Nor should people on the reservation feel division. I have seen healing come from this roadblock. I have for the first time seen both sides work together for a cause. This is America. Everyone deserves to have a voice and they deserve to have equal access to the resources on this land. They deserve to have a warm fire brewing in their home just as much as their neighbor. When we let race in America separate us we have lost the values that our constitution intended for each of us we "cannot" forget equality. It seems like such a great plan to give back to Native people and I for one think that America should but not this way. In the end this will not be giving back. Isn't there another way? In my opinion this Monument or talk of one never should have got this far. I saw the links that people literally fought with each other and the mean words that have been passed. I am a woman that stands for truth and goodness for all people and in all things. This Monument was not born from love for one another.	0	\N	\N	\N

We have since had several visitors.  They typically wanted to combine a trip to see friends with visits to some of the amazing parks here, which include sites listed as being under review.  \nBeyond my personal experience that suggests the economic value of the landscape here (i.e., tourism, which is growing, while coal-related jobs are shrinking), I have been in meetings with other citizens living in the state and heard the voices of tribal leaders.  I strongly support their views on protecting grounds they see as sacred.\n	0	\N	\N	\N

I want to tell you about my recent experience in Utah, which I visited last year.\n  \nOn that trip, arranged by Elder Hostel, we visited many of the State and National Parks and Monuments in Southern Utah.  We were accompanied by a geologist and an historian, and along the way we heard lectures about the history, culture and landscapes that we were seeing.  We had the opportunity to hike frequently, and meet some local people.\nIn our ten-day trip, we visited Snow Canyon State Park, Zion National Park, Bryce Canyon, Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument, Anasazi State Park, Capitol Reef National Park, Dead Horse State Park, Canyonlands National Park, Arches National Park, Monument Valley, a boating excursion on Lake Powell to Rainbow Bridge National Monument and finally Antelope Canyon.\n  \nLet me say how lucky I think you are having these magnificent landscapes so close to your home.  And how I would hope that you realize what a treasure they are for the rest of us who can only visit.  To give away these public lands, and yes, they are public, we are the government after all, would be selling our birthright, which I believe we were admonished to not do a long time ago. \n \nOn the trip the potential for exploitation, the extraction of coal, minerals, and other resources and the concomitant destruction of the landscape was discussed.  Not all of the people we talked to were opposed, but most were.  We did pass at least one reclamation project, where acres of toxic materials from prior exploration from many years ago were still being trucked to new locations, and the hope that some measure of restoration can occur.  No one was optimistic about this being done in our lifetimes, and if the current plans are implemented, perhaps never.\nI have seen in other states the effects of poorly managed reclamation, and some better managed attempts, both in the South and in Alaska.  I have not been impressed with the results.\n \nWhile I am getting older, I do hope to be able to repeat my trip, and spend more time in the magnificent landscapes I saw on this too brief trip.  \n\nI know that not all the Parks and Monuments I had the opportunity to visit are on the list to review, but some are, and I fear if started there will be pressure to review many other sites as well. With bad outcomes. \nI also hope to visit some of the other National Parks and Monuments on the list of sites under review.  And I hope that they will still be in public hands, not turned over to private enterprise, whose major purpose, understandably, is to maximize their profits and make the greatest return on their investments.  But, it is their purpose.  Their goals are not preservation of the lands, nor the preservation of our rights as citizens.  That is up to you, and the other people both elected to government office and appointed to oversee these public places.\n\nThank you for your attention.  \n	0	\N	\N	\N

They reach back into a past far distant, so that we and future generations can literally touch, walk around, and experience what truly makes America great; our understanding that our national monuments symbolize past, present and future generations bound together to protect our irreplaceable heritage of national lands and monuments.\n\nPlease conserve what cannot be replaced.  Do not destroy lands that represent America's history and heritage.\n\nSincerely.\n\nLorri A. Cook	0	\N	\N	\N

Any encroachment on these lands by businesses that want to harvest the timber or drill for oil or dig for coal will establish precedent for all our parks and monuments to be destroyed.  These lands have been under protection for 100 years and need to continue to be public.  Our children and theirs deserve to have the same places to enjoy and explore.	0	\N	\N	\N

857	DOI-2017-0002-0857	2017-05-12	I support and have always supported the Cascade Siskiyou National Monument and the expansion; I was at two of the 4 public hearings in 2016 to support the expansion, and both were widely advertised and one hearing held by Senator Merkley was packed to standing room, and was greatly for the expansion. The local government agencies and organizations were all supportive and present. People who say that there was not notice could not have been reading newspapers, watching news, or otherwise paying attention!  One area within the Monument is also a designated Wilderness, passed by Congress and signed by the President in 2009.. \nIt has been established by scientists to have ecological value due to its habitats and its value as a connector area for many species. It is the smallest Monument on the list being reviewed. \nPlease see my Facebook site for several albums of hundreds of photos of this area. They are heavily visited by local and national individuals for recreation and for recovery from the stresses of life.  \nFrankly, it would break the hearts of so many of us to see this reversed.\nSincerely, \nDiane Newell Meyer   	0	\N	\N	\N

863	DOI-2017-0002-0863	2017-05-12	I write in support of the Bears Ears National Monument designation.  As a resident of Montezuma County in Colorado, I can see the Bears Ears in Utah from my property. Despite accusations to the contrary, the process of designating the monument gave ample opportunity for local people like myself to comment and our comments were taken into consideration in the process.  President Trump's statement that he wants to "return control [of monuments] to the people, the people of Utah, the people of all of the states, the people of the United States" is patently absurd. U.S. national monuments by definition belong to the people of the United States -- they are controlled by our branches of government, and hence by the people. Equally absurd are comments that National Monuments represent land grabs by the federal government.  The lands of the Bears Ears National Monument belonged to the people of the United States before the monument designation and they continue to belong to the people of the United States once the monument was designated.\n\n That Bears Ears will be co-managed with Native American peoples is precisely the kind of positive improvement we need in monuments, to ensure that multiple perspectives and values are considered. Bears Ears is not an example of the Antiquities Act gone wrong -- but right.\n\nOur national parks and monuments are not an albatross for our nation or local communities, but the jewels in the crown of our home -- places that honor our continent's ancestors through the preservation of archaeological sites and places that protect the natural world on which we depend.\n\nGrowing up, I went to places like Wupatki National Monument and Chaco Canyon National Monument, which not only gave me a deep love of my home and nature, but helped spark a deep appreciation for our past. These places helped craft for me a sense of connection to my country and the people who made it. I eventually became a professional archaeologist -- in part, these places directed my life. The millions of Americans -- more than 330 million visits to just national parks last year alone -- who enjoy these public places clearly get a lot out of them as well.\n\nBears Ears National Monument is a key part of our nation's cultural and natural heritage. It must be preserved.\n	0	\N	\N	\N

I have lived in Maine for the last two years and the importance of public land has become more and more apparent to me.   I support the designation of Bears Ears National Monument and ask that it's boundaries remain unchanged.\n\nFor more than 100 years, Presidents of both parties have used the Antiquities Act-a tool signed into law by Theodore Roosevelt-to enact far-sighted protections for our common American inheritance. Bears Ears is exactly the kind of place the Antiquities Act intended to protect. It is rich in cultural history which inspired a historic coalition of tribes to band together to push for its designation. In addition to protecting over 100,000 archaeological sites, the designation preserves world-class recreation opportunities in places like Cedar Mesa, Grand Gulch, and Indian Creek.\n\nThe process that led to the designation of Bears Ears National Monument was thorough and transparent. For more than 80 years, decision makers from all sides presented proposals seeking permanent protection of all or part of this incredible landscape. The boundaries were informed by both the multi-year Public Lands Initiative and by a proposal from the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition. Those boundaries do not exceed the acreage necessary to preserve the rich cultural heritage, ecological values, and recreation assets.\n\nThank you for reviewing the decades of hard work and thoughtful consideration that culminated in the designation of Bears Ears National Monument.

I have no problem paying higher taxes to support these lands and the rich history of our nation they represent.	0	\N	\N	\N
904	DOI-2017-0002-0904	2017-05-12	I am in support of the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument. There is already evidence that this monument is providing much needed economic activity in a part of our state that has seen a great lose of jobs with the closing of paper mills in the region. As time goes on, there will be much needed job growth and economic activity. This is all great news for the region! Hopefully, the woods industry will be able to recover, diversify and grow in the future out side of the monument lands. I don't see why the monument and the woods industry can not be compatible. Also, remember that this land in question was privately owned and was unlikely to be used as commercial woodlands in the future. In addition, the Katahdin Woods and Waters Monument was a gift to the National Park Service along with a substantial endowment for operational needs. I am confident that in the future the monument will help bring prosperity to the people of the great State of Maine.	0	\N	\N	\N
905	DOI-2017-0002-0905	2017-05-12	Secretary Zinke, and those who review these comments,\n\nI wish to express my strongest support for the Bears Ears National Monument due to its "historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest" [Antiquities Act, 16 USC 431-433] as well as the support of our First Nations Peoples, American Indians. While I know the area is quite large, it is significantly smaller than what was requested and about the same size as Representative Bishop's Public Lands Initiative (PLI). These lands must be protected not only from industrial activities, primarily extraction, they must be preserved for us and all future generations. Unlike what several politicians and those against have stated, Bears Ears NM can be utilized for hunting, food gathering, hiking, climbing, professional archaeology, and exploring while allowing current mining and drilling permits to continue. While the lands are, in the conservative, anti-monument vernacular, "locked-up" they are available to many more people through minor transportation initiatives to bring people to the area which will generate stable economic growth for the surrounding community. This has happened near a majority of the NMs that have been created, especially Grand Escalante, the Grand Canyon NM (1908), Olympic Mountains NM (1909), White Sands NM (1933) and many others. \n\nAs an avid hiker and tourist, and coming from an outdoor family of fisherman, hunters, and birders, I have been grateful for the Antiquities Act and the National Monuments that have been created to protect our, the US People's, land. I now live in West Texas and I have dozens of excursions and trips planned to the National Parks (Olympic NP, Rainier NP), and National Monuments (Rio Grande Del Norte* [asterisk indicates part of this review], Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks*, Bandelier, Kasha-Katuwe Ten Rocks, White Sands, Prehistoric Trackways) this year alone that the Department of the Interior manages. I would be extremely disappointed, as would my conservative parents, if any of these would be removed especially Bears Ears and Grand Escalante because we will be travelling to these places in 2019 for my Mother's retirement celebration. \n\nWhile I understand you must balance economic growth and preservation, I urge you to keep these, and all National Monuments as they currently are and invest in repairing the infrastructure and advertising in America and Worldwide to come view, visit, tour and spend in our great nation.\n\nRegards,\n\nRandall Douty 	0	\N	\N	\N

910	DOI-2017-0002-0910	2017-05-12	The Katahdin Woods National Monument is a positive development for our state.In the short time of its existence, we've seen in increase in property values in the area and increased interest in business investment in many towns in the area which have not shared in the prosperity of Southern Maine. These towns have suffered tremendously from the decline of Maine's paper and forestry industry and do not have a new economic focal point other than outdoor recreation, which the Monument highlights.\n\nThe donors of this land parcel, Roxanne Quimby and Lucas St. Clair spent years speaking with local residents in town halls to air concerns and allow public comments. These were covered extensively on local news stations across the state. The region was very informed of the Monuments potential and most negative comments concerned access to the area for recreation, snowmobiling and hunting in particular. The area would have a minor impact on hunting in the region as areas within the monument have been opened up to this. \n\nThe negative arguments to this monument have proven to be unfounded thus far and I ask that you look at the increasing level of approval of this monument within our state. It will prove to be a positive force for our economic development in a region which has been neglected by the shifts in development in this increasingly isolated part of our state.\n\n	0	\N	\N	\N

The Katahadin Woods and Waters National Monument is a great step forward in the preservation of natural resources for future generations and I applaud the Obama Administration for this designation.

914	DOI-2017-0002-0914	2017-05-12	I adamantly oppose the review of National Monuments by the Department of the Interior and the Trump Administration. These areas not only preserve and protect important natural and cultural resources, but also are responsible for bringing long term, sustainable financial growth in the form of tourism to the surrounding regions. I support all of these monuments in their current state and will stand strongly against any reduction in size or rollback of protections afforded these monuments. The designation fo these areas protects not only local natural and cultural resources, and recreation opportunities, but also are vital to the people of the entire United States in that they are refuges from the stresses of the modern world.  Specifically,  I support Bears Ears Monument and the Native Americans who have inhabited that area for thousands of years and their desire to protect culturally important areas from destruction by developers and government entities.

921	DOI-2017-0002-0921	2017-05-12	As an outdoor enthusiast who loves our public lands, I support the designation of Bears Ears National Monument and ask that its boundaries remain unchanged.\n\nFor more than 100 years, presidents of both parties have used the Antiquities Act-a tool signed into law by Theodore Roosevelt-to enact far-sighted protections for our common American inheritance. Bears Ears is exactly the kind of place the Antiquities Act intended to protect. It is rich in cultural history which inspired a historic coalition of tribes to band together to push for its designation. In addition to protecting over 100,000 archaeological sites, the designation preserves world-class recreation opportunities in places like Cedar Mesa, Grand Gulch, and Indian Creek.\n\nThe process that led to the designation of Bears Ears National Monument was thorough and transparent. For more than 80 years, decision makers from all sides presented proposals seeking permanent protection of all or part of this incredible landscape. The boundaries were informed by both the multi-year Public Lands Initiative and by a proposal from the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition. Those boundaries do not exceed the acreage necessary to preserve the rich cultural heritage, ecological values, and recreation assets.\n\nThank you for reviewing the decades of hard work and thoughtful consideration that culminated in the designation of Bears Ears National Monument. Please recommend that President Trump leave the current Bears Ears National Monument boundaries in place.	0	\N	\N	\N

This land was private, then donated to the people for a National Monument. This was a selfless act and by threatening to shrink or remove it, this administration has issued an attack to philanthropists and the many Americans that enjoy both Katahdin NM as well as the 116 other National Monuments across this great land. I believe, that we should utilize Trump's America First slogan and hearken back to the late 1800s early 1900s with a campaign to "See America First" and celebrate these great lands and people.\n\nI urge you to listen to those who will enjoy these lands for decades to come instead of the profiteers and industrialists in it for the short term. To use a phrase from Theodore Roosevelt, we need a "square deal" that balances preservation, conservation, use and privatization.

925	DOI-2017-0002-0925	2017-05-12	I am writing to share my support for the Maine Katahdin Woods and Waters Monument. I have been a Maine resident, working here owning property for over 37 years. I choose to live and work in Maine for the access to wild and natural places represented by this National Monument. Already Katahdin Woods and Waters is proving to be a destination spot for people in the east who want to experience the natural wonders of an environment that is unique. \n         The area is also seeing a resurgence economically from the Monument designation, creating jobs for Maine people in the area, as guide services, hotel, motel, and restaurants are seeing increases in visitor traffic. \n         This was a a huge area of privately held land which was donated as a National Monument, along with over a million dollars to help with care and upkeep of it. This pristine wilderness area now belongs to the people of Maine and the US and needs to remain as a National Monument for all to enjoy and appreciate as a natural wilderness. If this designation were reveresed, and the current Governor of Maine has any jurisdiction over it, the deforestation of this wilderness area would happen very quickly, as he has made clear were his intentions. When this land was privately held the owners strongly opposed deforestation, and that is one reason they wanted the land help in perpetuity for citizens of Maine and the US to see a natural pristine northern wilderness in the US, with all the flora and fauna inherent to it.\n	0	\N	\N	\N

I lived for three decades in the rural West, worked on a cattle ranch, hunted, fished, hiked and camped my way around New Mexico, Colorado and Montana.  All those years living amongst and becoming friends with ranchers and wheat farmers, outdoors men and women, I've long since come to see that the Federal Government has way, way too much control and power over our lives, including the taking over of huge tracts of open land throughout our great country.  Most especially in the West.  \n\nFrankly, I find it utterly shameful and I ask you most respectfully to recommend that the President revoke all land grabs that President Obama did, in addition to reverting others prior to Obama.  There's absolutely nothing in the Constitution that gives the President the power to unilaterally grab up land for the Feds to "manage".\n\nPlease, please, do the right thing.	1	\N	\N	\N

933	DOI-2017-0002-0933	2017-05-12	I would like to express my support for the Katadin Woods & Waters National Monument in Maine. I am a life-long resident of Maine and have been a Registered Maine Guide for the past 33 years. I have spent much time in Millinocket, Maine and the surrounding area in my capacity as a white water rafting guide on the West Branch of the Penobscot River. When I began rafting on the West branch in 1984, this area was thriving economically as the paper mills were providing a strong base for a number of communities near the site of the new national monument.This is not the case today. Many services, including schools and municipal institutions have been severely curtailed or eliminated because of the wide-spread, pervasive and sustained economic downturn that continues for the region. The creation of the Katadin Woods & Waters National Monument was characterized by resistance to its creation by a small, but vocal group of local landowners and residents who hope for a return to the heyday of forest products manufacturing and preserve what they perceived as their "right" to hunt and fish anywhere they pleased. This is not a reasonable or realistic response to the monument's creation, nor does it help the thousands of citizens who are desperately seeking a means to maintain both their homes and their livelihoods. The Katadin Woods & Waters National Monument is much more than acreage to most of the Katadin Region's population. It is a symbol of hope for a viable lifestyle and the prospect of stable, sustainable economic improvement in the area.   \nChange is not typically welcomed in most areas of the State of Maine. Perhaps the granite coastline is symbolic of the attitude of many citizens of Maine that feels our state is fine just the way it is.  Katadin Woods & Waters represents a new beginning for the north-central region. Many public meetings were held and passionate points of view were exchanged both for and against the monument.  Sadly, as with so many initiatives today, the process has become horribly politicized, pitting a small-minded, petty and frankly ignorant governor, Paul LePage against the scientifically accurate and well established reasons for keeping the building momentum of the monument. A political hack trying to curry favor with the current administration in Washington is a poor reason to reverse the positive impact this monument has had, and will have for future generations of Maine citizens.\nScott Phair	0	\N	\N	\N

935	DOI-2017-0002-0935	2017-05-12	This comment is written in support of the public lands designated as national monuments via the Antiquities Act. As an outdoors enthusiast I recognize not only the intrinsic value of these wild tracts, but also their massive economic value to rural communities, the travel industry, and the outdoors industry. Rolling back monument designations, opening public tracts to mining, or any degradation of protections guarding these lands will be an assault on the property and rights of the American public in the interest of e reactive industries. The present review is clearly and unabashedly a land grab with the ultimate goal of privitivzing public lands. Data show indisputably that when western states obtain title to previously protected federal lands, they open them to extractive industry and development in exchange for a false promise of rural employment. \n\nThe Antiquities Act is an invaluable framework for protecting cultural resources, cultural and historic properties, and culturally invaluable landscapes. Any roll back on the Antiquities Act or the monuments designated through its scope will be an attack on American cultural resources, American heritage, and American public properties. As an professional anthropologist and archaeologist I know the value of this Act and the monuments it protects. Any weakening of the Act will lead to unmitigated looting, and will embolden developers to destroy RHP eligible  properties  on federal land. Any transfer of monument land to the states will amount to a massive weakening of the protections for historic properties, properties owned by the American people. \n\nAny weakening of the Antiquities Act or its monument lands will not stand. Any effort toward this vile end will be met with unheard of resistance. The American people will not be silent or passive. The current administration will lose this battle, if not in court, then in Bears Ears, or on the ground in any of the now threatened monument lands. \n\nThis effort is an assault on American public property. It is undemocratic, and it is entirely unamerican. The outdoor community, scientific community, conservation community, and archaeological community will resist, as will hundreds of indigenous American groups. We will fight for our shared properties, and oppose their destruction under the hand of extractive industry. \n\n\n\n	0	\N	\N	\N

938	DOI-2017-0002-0938	2017-05-12	I am writing this comment in regards to Katahdin wood and waters monument in Maine.  I am a lifelong Mainer who has earned a living working in Maine's forest products industry.  I have had the unique opportunity to work for the National Park Service while I was attending college as a summer job.  I worked in a small National Recreation Area in the Southwest and gained valuable life experience through the course of my two summers there.  I was able to see first-hand the enormous effort and energy it requires to successfully operate Dept of Interior property.  Consequently, this experience has allowed me the insight to criticize some of the claims associated with the Katahdin Woods Monument.  For example, the $40 million endowment certainly sounds like a lot of money to enhance operation of the monument, but this really represents less than a year of likely operational costs.  Additionally, the prospect of new jobs in a relatively depressed area is misleading.  I refer to my own experience; I was hired from Maine to work in a similarly depressed area in the Southwest, I certainly did not qualify as a local resource.  Don't be surprised to come to Maine and be greeted by Monument employees with a deep southern drawl...\n\nWhile the endeavor to protect some of Maine's scenic beauty is a noble one, we have a rich timber heritage in Maine.  We (as recreationists) have long enjoyed the open access provided by Maine's large landowners.  While the ownership landscape is quickly changing from resource based business to REIT's and other investment groups, the general freedom to "go upcountry" and pursue the activity of your choosing is still available.  Not entirely so in a National Monument.  I don't think Maine is quite ready to turn its back on all its heritage just yet.  I strongly encourage the Department of the Interior to eliminate the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument in Maine.   	0	\N	\N	\N
939	DOI-2017-0002-0939	2017-05-12	RE: Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument in Maine.\n\nI live about 2 hours from the Monument and plan on visiting to camp, hike and bike regularly. While doing so, I will camp or stay in a local motel or outdoor sports center. Shortly after it opened, my dog and I headed to the Monument from a local yoga retreat we stayed at in the area. Several others guests joined us as they had heard about it on the national news and welcomed the opportunity to visit. All of them loved it and said they would return to Maine and at least in part to visit the monument again. Since its opening, I know of many people who were excited to visit the monument and have done so. Of course this means they pay for lodging, buy food, gas and other supplies which helps the local economy. They went up for hiking, biking, skiing, etc. and plan to return regularly.\nMy dog and I are heading there again in two weeks. We were going to go next week but have delayed our trip to wait for the access roads to open. We are going to explore the monument and will spend quite a bit on our stay in the area.\nIn addition, I know hikers with dogs who are thrilled to have hiking opportunities in the area as Baxter State Park does not allow dogs to be in the park at all.\nI live close to Acadia National Park and every day I see the positive economic impact it as on our region. We all would be in a lot of financial trouble if we didn't have our summer visitors to the park. In response to all those in opposition to the monument, I would point out that the paper industry was declining and moving jobs out of Maine long before the Monument. I do not see the benefit of promoting or protecting a declining industry when we have ecotourism as a more lucrative and sustainable option that actually has a future. Please do not take this future away from the residents of Maine. The area needs jobs, hope and options. The National Monument provides that and so much more.	0	\N	\N	\N
940	DOI-2017-0002-0940	2017-05-12	Dear Secretary Zinke,\n\nI am writing to express my strong support for ALL National Monuments created both before and since 1996 and do not support rescinding or reducing in size any National Monument at all.   \n\nThese important protected lands provide critical opportunities for all Americans to recreate, to enjoy undisturbed nature and in many cases such as Bears Ears, Grand Staircase Escalante and Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monuments certain stipulations were written into the monument proclamations to allow traditional uses such as cattle grazing, foraging by Native Americans, snowmobiling and hunting to continue to support the wishes of local residents and governments.  \n\nUnfortunately many unsubstantiated claims and outright falsehoods have been made as justification towards the opposition of these national monuments. \n\nThe claim that these monuments were created without sufficient local involvement is simply fallacious. While there was some initial opposition in specific cases, in all of the communities near the monuments many residents and businesses have embraced the designations and have seen their economies grow. \n\nWhen Congress granted the Antiquities Act to the President's Office in 1906 they knew well that the current President Theodore Roosevelt would act aggressively to protect land and he did, establishing large monuments to protect who landscapes and ecosystems such as the Grand Canyon, Lassen Peak and Mount Olympus, all of which later became well beloved National Parks.\n\nThe public has consistently expressed strong support for our National Monuments and I strongly urge you to listen to the public instead of a handful of spiteful politicians and small pockets of local governments who seek to turn back the clock to be able to extract personal wealth from these monuments instead of having them protected for the entire country and for future generations.  \n\nIn the communities where you are reviewing the monuments time has begun to heal any wounds caused by the creation of the monuments and I urge you to let the healing continue by leaving all of these incredible National Monuments alone and intact.  \n\nThank you.\n	0	\N	\N	\N

We have just completed a 3600 sq. ft. expansion of our retail space and the addition of two new employees. We have done this because of the very impressive response by visitors to the Monument over the past nine months. We have also noticed a marked difference of attitude toward the designation by many local people who originally opposed it.\nWe truly believe that the Katahdin region now has an opportunity to work together to change the economic and aspirational energy that will create jobs and future positive growth within the Monument area. We look forward to the challenge ahead and only ask that this region be given the opportunity to realign its economic footprint. The Quimby family and their associates have been extremely helpful to us, the local communities, and the organizations who are working so diligently to make this happen.\nThank you for this opportunity to express my opinion.\n	0	\N	\N	\N

We camped, hiked, attended programs and viewed the stars.  In so doing we developed a deep appreciation for our heritage in this country.  As an adult our family had a camper and, again, visited these places with our children.  They have continued this beloved activity and our grandchildren are growing up with an appreciation of our heritage.  These monuments were so designated for many reasons not the least of which was to enrich the lives of citizens and to teach children and adults about our heritage.  I fully object to giving away our national heritage to commercial firms or to the states in any way, through giveaways, through leasing for destructive activities or for private gain.

955	DOI-2017-0002-0955	2017-05-12	Good Morning,  I am writing to request DOI Secretary Zinke return a recommendation to President Trump to continue to protect ALL these National Monuments, Parks, and other federal lands in their current status. As an avid hiker, I know how delicate these lands are.  As an American growing up in the Northeast, I remember the wonder of climbing Mt. Katahdin, and exploring the New England coastline. All children deserve to have this kind of opportunity. As an adult in the metro-mid-Atlantic area, I treasure every moment I can get away to visit family and experience the wonders of places like Grand Staircase-Escalante, the Four Corners area including the Bear's Ears National Monument, and other one-of-a-kind locations that make our country so unique and beautiful.  Once these places are turned over to commercial interests, there is no repairing the damage.  The fragility of these locations can not be overstated.  Many of these places are also the ancestral, sacred homeland for our Native American citizens, who have already been mis-treated by our government for so long.  These lands are all far more valuable as a resource to all Americans, to be savored and enjoyed for the centuries to come, than to be exploited for short-term commercial interests.  The role of the federal government is to deliver on exactly this kind of mission:  To protect for the good of all, the beauty and value of our country, unique in the world.  Thank you for taking my comments into consideration. 	0	\N	\N	\N

The whole point of designating something as a national monument, is to preserve it for future generations and not let our national natural spaces disappear and be used for commercialization purposes. A national monument is a land or historic area that has been given permanent protection by Congress or by the president through the use of the Antiquities Act. PERMANENT. This should not be able to be undone on a whim, or by anyone. Save our beautiful spaces where we can camp, hike, enjoy the wilderness, and observe and experience our history.

957	DOI-2017-0002-0957	2017-05-12	In regards to the fallacy that there was no local input regarding the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument I can tell you, that as the owner for 31 year of WSYY AM/FM, the local radio station, this is not true. In the years approaching the designation of the monument, there were many local forums for people to state their views as we put them on the air so that everyone in the area would be aware of the forums and could attend if they want to do so. In fact, at one point, we had paid ads in regard to the KWW National Monument.  It is just not true that there was no opportunity for local input into the creation of the KWW National Monument. \n\nThe fact of the matter is, that after years and years of a declining area, the National Monument has given the area hope and is creating growth in the area. WSYY has $300K expansion plans that will not go forward if the National Monument is rescinded. Neither Gov. LePage or Donald Trump has created any jobs in the Katahdin area, the National Monument, despite being less than a year old, has already created jobs and business expansion in the area. Gov. LePage, to the best of my knowledge has never visited the National Monument as he considers anything other than the coastal area of Maine to be the "mosquito area." Of course the mosquitoes, according to LePage,  seem to not be in Baxter State Park, despite the fact that KWW and Baxter share a common border. I guess the mosquitoes hate the federal government too, so they stay out of Baxter and only go to the federal land. The national and international exposure that the KWW National Monument has brought to this area is something that no state park could ever bring to this area. \n\nUnder President Trump's criteria the KWW National Monument is under 100,000 acres and there was plenty of opportunity for local input so it does not qualify to be rescinded and in fact does not qualify for review under Trump's executive order. 	0	\N	\N	\N

959	DOI-2017-0002-0959	2017-05-12	Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument has figured prominently in the Maine news feed for months both prior to and following its designation as a national monument. Located in the State of Maine it impacts not only those who live adjacent to its boundaries but also those of us who live further south, east or west of the monument. Our family has made many trips over the years to this area and watched the decline in viable employment for those living in the Millinocket area. Following the announcement of the monument and its subsequent media promotion, we have seen a surge of economic growth in this geographic area - not to mention a substantial monetary investment in a natural resource education facility. We are dismayed at the recent push back on monument status. Maine residents - both local and from other areas of the state - have been informed in great detail as to the process and progress of the designation. It is "fake news" - to quote a current phrase - to assert that residents did not have an opportunity to offer input on the process. During public meetings residents from small rural communities expressed their concerns that their way of life would be negatively impacted. These concerns were duly noted, however since the monument has been in effect all indications are the opposite. Economic growth, increase in real estate values and growing tourist interest have all occurred. I address the public input issue as this is what is noted in your decision making process. However, in my mind, setting aside this beautiful area of the state for future generations to enjoy is a key component in reviewing this monument. There are many diverse groups who are now stakeholders in this process. To re-politicize the monument's designation not only impedes its growth but it also questions whether public input, made in good faith, is viable. As Mainers, we should be able to help direct the path of this valuable land - not persons with grudges, persons pursuing thinly veiled political opportunities.\nThank you for this opportunity to share our thoughts with you. As the Woody Guthrie song reminds us -\n"This land is your land...this land is my land"  Let's look clearly at what is at stake and what the ramifications to overturning the designation will be for all of us.  \n	0	\N	\N	\N

They are truly a treasure and a unique feature of our democratic country that I treasure both personally, and on behalf of our nation.\n\nSecond of all, my understanding is that a president cannot undo designations by a previous president without an act of Congress.\n\nFinally, since I'm a history teacher, I'd like to close by quoting Teddy Roosevelt.  I don't agree with Roosevelt about everything, but he is one of my favorite past presidents and his conviction and belief in our great nation remains admirable to this day.  And I am with him on this:\n\n"Moreover, I believe that the natural resources must be used for the benefit of all our people, and not monopolized for the benefit of the few, and here again is another case in which I am accused of taking a revolutionary attitude. People forget now that one hundred years ago there were public men of good character who advocated the nation selling its public lands in great quantities, so that the nation could get the most money out of it, and giving it to the men who could cultivate it for their own uses. We took the proper democratic ground that the land should be granted in small sections to the men who were actually to till it and live on it. Now, with the water power, with the forests, with the mines, we are brought face to face with the fact that there are many people who will go with us in conserving the resources only if they are to be allowed to exploit them for their benefit. That is one of the fundamental reasons why the special interests should be driven out of politics. Of all the questions which can come before this nation, short of the actual preservation of its existence in a great war, there is none which compares in importance with the great central task of leaving this land even a better land for our descendants than it is for us, and training them into a better race to inhabit the land and pass it on. Conservation is a great moral issue, for it involves the patriotic duty of insuring the safety and continuance of the nation. Let me add that the health and vitality of our people are at least as well worth conserving as their forests, waters, lands, and minerals, and in this great work the national government must bear a most important part."\n\nThank you for your time.\n\n	0	\N	\N	\N

973	DOI-2017-0002-0973	2017-05-12	President's Executive Order calling for a review of all national monuments designated through use of the Antiquities Act since 1996 has me extremely concerned. Each of the monuments listed were created with overwhelming public support and must remain undisturbed. When Teddy Roosevelt signed the Antiquities Act in 1906 his intention was to safeguard and preserve federal lands and cultural and historical sites for all people to enjoy. Since then, 16 presidents from both parties have used this authority to protect stunning landscapes, including the Grand Canyon, Acadia, Zion and Olympic National Parks. More recently, the Act has also been used to protect places like Bears Ears -- spanning 1.35 million acres in southeastern Utah and home to centuries worth of cultural artifacts including cliff dwellings, hogans, and pictographs, in addition to being revered land for several Native tribes.\n\n\n\nThere is no need for a review to demonstrate what my family knows and appreciates-- national monuments provide tangible health, natural, and economic benefits. Protected outdoor spaces drive the outdoor recreation economy which supports 7.6 million jobs and generates $887 billion in consumer spending each year. National monuments and public lands are vital both for the history they preserve and the future they offer.\n\n\n\nOur public lands help define who we are as a nation. Instead of asking asking which parts of our history and heritage we could eliminate, please ask how we can make our land more protected	0	\N	\N	\N

I want to advocate in the strongest possible way my support for the full preservation of all the currently designated national monuments and parks, and to lend my assistance in any way I can to help keep them the wonderful resources they are to all Americans and international visitors.\n\nI have just returned from the southwest, where I had the chance to camp and hike in many of the iconic national parks, but also to see the fragile natural beauty of national monuments such as Grand Staircase-Escalante and Bears Ears. Nothing prepared me for their unique and beautiful landscapes. Everyone I met locally felt they were an economic and recreational asset to their communities nearby.  This was during public school spring break in Utah and California, so I was able to hear from many families from Utah who were unequivocally in favor of the creation of these monuments, despite political protestation from their own governor and certain members of Congress.\n\nI hope the public comments from other American citizens will be strong enough to indicate how treasured our public lands are by all of us who give thanks continually to the vision and wisdom of former members of Congress and former presidents in creating our national park system and the National Park Service to manage them under the Department of the Interior.\n\nPlease know that I would willingly pay more in federal taxes to support the mission of our National Park Service.

Energy companies are bad at hiding their motives, and it's obvious that the monuments are on the chopping block because these companies are only interested in tearing them apart to make a profit. We need to stop being so short-sided when it comes to how we get our energy (like by destroying these national monuments for a quick solve to cheap energy) and think seriously about long-term solutions by working on ground-breaking innovations that actually move us forward and position us globally as new energy leaders. \n\nNature, too especially such exquisite examples as those elevated to "national monument" status is the most incredible salve for the soul. The number of people that would be able to get their energy from whatever's sucked out of these places is a fraction of the number who, for many generations to come, would be emotionally restored and spiritually moved by visiting them. These places are national gems that should be showcased, not compromised.\n\nThis quote from Theodore Roosevelt's "New Nationalism" speech from 1910 best sums up what I'm trying to say: \n\n"Now, with the water power, with the forests, with the mines, we are brought face to face with the fact that there are many people who will go with us in conserving the resources only if they are to be allowed to exploit them for their benefit.

Leadership requires looking beyond the immediate desires of business interests, personal desires and political pressures and take the long view of courageous stewardship of our country and stand for the protection of these incredible spaces.\n\nThe economic impact of destroying or rescinding the protections of these National Monuments cannot be underestimated.  My own experiences of visiting these sites has only re-enforced the incredible impact to the local economies visitors to these sites have on the success of businesses, municipalities and people in my mind.  I spoke with a local business owner while visiting Yosemite and hearing his assessment of the economic impact of nearly 4.5 million visitors has was compelling.  (I realize Yosemite is not a National Monument, but my point stands)\n\nPlease do not destroy the work of past generations to protect our national treasures for our future.  Keep ALL of our National Monuments,parks and lands safe from the greed of business capitalists and allow our children a chance to understand to power of natural beauty.\n\nThank you,\nBlake Mazurek	0	\N	\N	\N
982	DOI-2017-0002-0982	2017-05-12	It is terrifying to me that with a pen stroke Donald Trump can remove protections from some of our most significant resources. Why would he do this? It seems to me the only reason to remove protections from these lands and waters is so that they can be raped of their natural resources for big profits by big companies. I find it shameful that money would be placed ahead of the value of spaces and places that make our country unique and beautiful. These are not only beautiful spaces but also the home and habitat of all God's creatures. If they aren't worth protecting then what is? What does this say about American culture? What is done by this action cannot be undone. Once the monuments are gone we cannot get them back. 	0	\N	\N	\N
983	DOI-2017-0002-0983	2017-05-12	Hello, \n\nI'm supportive of commercial use of national lands but only when such use is closely regulated to prevent environmental and/or historical or cultural damage. Our country's track record when it comes to responsible use of our resources isn't great. Let's not turn Bear's Ears into a future Superfund site or destroy a site significant to Native Americans.\n\nThank you\n	0	\N	\N	\N
995	DOI-2017-0002-0995	2017-05-12	I, having lived in Maine all my life, really believe that the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument will be an\n economic boom for the people of that area and for all of inland Maine. This is a very economically depressed area\n after having lost many paper mills and wood product mills in the past 15 years. I would urge you not to take this economic\nopportunity away from the people of that area.  Thank you.	0	\N	\N	\N
984	DOI-2017-0002-0984	2017-05-12	I find it appalling that DOI is considering to eliminate National Monuments and to basically ignored the reason for the National Antiquities Act. Obviously, you have forgotten about America's Best Idea!! This administration will start with these monuments then move on to eliminate National Historic Sites, National Parks, National Seashores, and other public lands saved for us and future generations to enjoy and respect. As you start with Bears Ears then move on to your list, I feel John Muir, President Theodore Roosevelt who created 18 National Monuments, Stephen Mather, Horace Albright and the women and men who worked hard to save our National Treasures would all be appalled if they were alive today to see what this administration is doing! I implore you to save our national treasures from destruction and elimination as well as from the executive order to allow oil drilling, natural gas drilling and other destructing pollutors from these public lands.	0	\N	\N	\N
985	DOI-2017-0002-0985	2017-05-12	As an outdoor enthusiast, conservationist, and concerned human who loves our public lands, I support the designation of Bears Ears National Monument and request that it's boundaries remain unchanged.  A huge amount of work, comments, back and forth, and negotiations already went into creating the Bears Ears National Monument, why are we rehashing this again now?\n\nFor more than 100 years, Presidents of both parties have used the Antiquities Act-a tool signed into law by Theodore Roosevelt-to enact far-sighted protections for our common American inheritance. Bears Ears is exactly the kind of place the Antiquities Act intended to protect. It is rich in cultural history which inspired a historic coalition of tribes to band together to push for its designation. In addition to protecting over 100,000 archaeological sites, the designation preserves world-class recreation opportunities in places like Cedar Mesa, Grand Gulch, and Indian Creek.\n\nThe process that led to the designation of Bears Ears National Monument was thorough and transparent. For more than 80 years, decision makers from all sides presented proposals seeking permanent protection of all or part of this incredible landscape. The boundaries were informed by both the multi-year Public Lands Initiative and by a proposal from the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition. Those boundaries do not exceed the acreage necessary to preserve the rich cultural heritage, ecological values, and recreation assets.\n\nThank you for reviewing the decades of hard work and thoughtful consideration that culminated in the designation of Bears Ears National Monument. Please recommend that President Trump leave the current Bears Ears National Monument boundaries in place.	0	\N	\N	\N
986	DOI-2017-0002-0986	2017-05-12	I oppose the "review of certain National Monuments." \n\nI have lived in Arizona for 6 years, and have family in New Mexico and Colorado. I am most familiar with the establishment of Bears Ears National Monument and Organ Mountains- Desert Peaks National Monument. These monument were established including full public involvement. \n\nThe 1.3 million acres included in the Bears Ears National Monument did not expand government land holdings in any way. Those acres represented public lands already owned by the federal government (and small portion of state lands). It did not include or affect any private lands. \n\nNational Monument designations improve the economy of surrounding communities. At Grand-Staircase Escalante, growth in the local health care and tourism industries increased overall wages in the region by more than $20 million since that monument was established, and population, employment, personal income, and per capita income all rose since the monument designation.\n\nNational Monument designations protect natural and cultural resources. I have visited archaeological sites on Cedar Mesa in what is now the Bears Ears National Monument. These archaeological sites need our protection from looting and desecration. The designation of Bears Ears was made in full consultation with public groups and with Native American tribal organizations in the area. The National Monument designation helps protect areas of spiritual significance and ongoing cultural activities for the tribes.\n\nWhen folks in Washington D.C. or areas in the North East see acreages listed in the hundreds of thousands (or millions) of acres, they might be shocked. But for those of us that live in the Four Corners where the sky is big and the desert is even bigger, sites like Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks are just tiny fractions of the landscape. Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks is approximately 775 square miles in area, or 0.6% of the total area of the state of New Mexico. In the southwest the land is large, and National Monument designations only make sense here if they can encompass the greatness of the landscapes that they protect.\n\nI oppose the "review of certain National Monuments" and I encourage Secretary Zinke to carefully consider his review of these areas and speak with all stakeholder groups before making any determinations.\n	0	\N	\N	\N

989	DOI-2017-0002-0989	2017-05-12	My belief is that areas such as the Rio Grande del Norte and Organ Peaks should maintain their protected status.  These areas will be lost forever to development should the current status be reversed and for the sake of our future generations should remain preserved, to do otherwise would be selfish.\nAs world population creeps upward the importance of preservation of these unique areas becomes even more important, better to take a long view of this situation rather than a shortsighted approach.	0	\N	\N	\N
990	DOI-2017-0002-0990	2017-05-12	Please leave the parks and monuments as they are now. As Ken Burns series " The National Parks " said, the national parks are America's best idea.

These lands are imperative to preserve wildlife as well as historic artifacts. \n\nBesides the fact that there is no grounds to do this, it would not only be illegal but a horrible idea! \n\nPROTECT THE LAND NOT YOUR WALLET!!!	0	\N	\N	\N
993	DOI-2017-0002-0993	2017-05-12	Please do not remove protection from any of these monuments. It is more vital than ever to make a real effort to preserve fragile life and ecosystems. There is no reason to not keep them protected that would be in the public interest. Private corporation potential profits is not a valid concern here. Sources of energy are not a concern because we now have many alternative sources now that are far less invasive to the natural world.

994	DOI-2017-0002-0994	2017-05-12	I have grown up in the west and spent my entire life exploring our wonderful country.  One thing that sets us apart from the rest of the world is our public land.  Preserving large chunks of the west is vital to the future well being of our country.  On a recent visit to the exquisite Bears Ears National Monument, my 9 year old son became enthralled with finding ancient ruins.  He was able in just one trip to see the value of preserving our national heritage. We need more monument, not less.  Drilling for natural gas has been beneficial to our country, but there is a point where we must stop and consider the land for what it is, a place to escape to from our daily lives and rejuvenate.  The monuments that have been created over the last two decades must retain their status or we will find ourselves going back and soon enough changing the status of all parks for the greed of our nations corporations.  Ladies and gentlemen welcome to Wells Fargo's Yellowstone National Park!	0	\N	\N	\N
996	DOI-2017-0002-0996	2017-05-12	I like most do not want drilling or mining on these lands but we do want access to them. I do believe we need to protect our lands but we also need access to them. These lands do contain large amounts of coal and other natural resources but if it was a profitable option it would have been done years and years ago. The BLM has closed off way to much of these areas for recreation. Make the protected areas smaller If we truly feel that that these areas need full park protection then they should be designated and funded by Congress not in the 11th hour of a presidency. I do believe in the Antiquities Act but this is an abuse of the law, and not in the intended use.    	0	\N	\N	\N
997	DOI-2017-0002-0997	2017-05-12	Secretary ZInke:\n\nI have been exploring the area now known as the Bears Ears National Monument since April 1979. It is one of the most remarkable landscapes I know in the United States, perhaps even the world. I have had the good fortune to walk among the ruins of the Maya in the Yucatan and the Khmer in Angkor Wat. I have visited the ancient Buddhist monasteries of Upper Mustang in Nepal. The Ancestral Puebloan ruins of the Bears Ears National Monument are of equal beauty and importance, and you have the choice to preserve them or to allow them to be destroyed.\n\nThe Bears Ears National Monument is, quite literally, an outdoor museum where one can walk in the footsteps of the Ancestral Puebloans, visit where they lived, and encounter their material culture in situ. I have found large, beautifully decorated potsherds, projectile points, parts of yucca sandals, a piece of a rabbit hair blanket. I have marveled at these 800-year-old creations made by humans who went before, all in a place of breathtaking physical beauty and amazing geology. I have assisted friends who would otherwise be unable to visit perfectly intact backcountry kivas. I have known the wonder of exploration and have savored vistas that most Americans will never see. I have gazed upon the Milky Way on a moonless night in one darkest skies in America, Cedar Mesa, Utah.  \n\nI also have seen the wanton destruction done by the San Juan County, Utah Road and Bridge Department when they illegally bulldozed a road to Moon House Ruin in McCloyd Canyon using a bogus R.S. 2477 claim to rationalize their vandalism. I have seen the increase in visitation brought by this careless act that threatens the integrity of this unparalleled ruin complex. I have seen middens dug by hand and by backhoe. I have seen illegal ATV tracks and and picked up the garbage left behind by mindless yahoos. I have seen viga timbers ripped out of ancient structures and used for firewood. I have seen fragile walls toppled by careless visitors. I have seen piles of cow dung in the remains of sacred kivas. I have seen fragile desert waterholes fouled by cattle. \n\nI have seen a thousand very good reasons for the protections afforded by President Barack Obama's designation of the Bears Ears National Monument to remain in place and intact. I implore you to not undo this remarkable national treasure to placate the noisy voices of extremism shouting in San Juan County, Utah, Salt Lake City and the halls of Congress. I ask you to come visit the heart of the Bears Ears backcountry. I would be happy to take you to places that would blow your mind and broaden your perspective, all away from the glare of TV cameras and the pressure of those who wish to destroy this place, those who shepherded you on your recent visit to Utah. \n\nPlease visit the monument personally and in depth, not just the rushed "drive-by" you did with the opponents of the Bears Ears National Monument. Walk its canyons, marvel at its amazing cultural resources, listen to the dulcet call of the canyon wren, and be in awe of God's creation. \n\nThe shrill voices of the Utah Congressional Delegation and the misguided Governor Herbert should NOT carry more weight than that of the Native Americans whose tribes have deep cultural ties to this remarkable landscape. The decision comes with a heavy moral burden to FINALLY honor commitments made by the United States government and the sovereign tribal nations that revere the Bears Ears as a sacred place. I too share their reverence for the Bears Ears.\n\nI implore you to honor the commitments made to the five tribes that comprise the Bears Ears Intertribal Coalition, the Navajo, White Mesa Ute, Ute Mountain Ute, Zuni and Hopi. The utterly unique co-management agreement with these tribal entities should be honored, as well as the physical integrity of the Bears Ears National Monument itself.  \n\nYou have the opportunity to do the right thing. Please don't choose the (perceived) politically expedient thing. Do the honorable thing that will preserve the Bears Ears National Monument for generations of Americans to come.\n	3	\N	\N	\N

999	DOI-2017-0002-0999	2017-05-12	I'm writing to express my anger and astonishment over the review of national monuments, and to urge the government to protect the natural wonders that, to quote from our commander in chief, "Make America Great." \n\nI understand that the current administration views corporate interest above that of the electorate, however big businesses have historically shown little to no impulse to "self-regulate," especially regarding environmental issues. I'll let the great Theodore Roosevelt provide the foundation of my argument:\n\n"Moreover, I believe that the natural resources must be used for the benefit of all our people, and not monopolized for the benefit of the few, and here again is another case in which I am accused of taking a revolutionary attitude. People forget now that one hundred years ago there were public men of good character who advocated the nation selling its public lands in great quantities, so that the nation could get the most money out of it, and giving it to the men who could cultivate it for their own uses. We took the proper democratic ground that the land should be granted in small sections to the men who were actually to till it and live on it. Now, with the water power, with the forests, with the mines, we are brought face to face with the fact that there are many people who will go with us in conserving the resources only if they are to be allowed to exploit them for their benefit. That is one of the fundamental reasons why the special interests should be driven out of politics. Of all the questions which can come before this nation, short of the actual preservation of its existence in a great war, there is none which compares in importance with the great central task of leaving this land even a better land for our descendants than it is for us, and training them into a better race to inhabit the land and pass it on. Conservation is a great moral issue, for it involves the patriotic duty of insuring the safety and continuance of the nation. Let me add that the health and vitality of our people are at least as well worth conserving as their forests, waters, lands, and minerals, and in this great work the national government must bear a most important part."\n\nDo the right thing, if you don't you will be replaced by someone who will. 	0	\N	\N	\N
