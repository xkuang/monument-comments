I have faith that a man like yourself, that comes from the beautiful state of Montana understands how important it is to protect our natural monuments. Large land masses that if left unprotected would run the risk of being destroyed over time by development, privatization, overuse, and misuse. It is essential in a large country such as ours, that we reserve essential acreage in it's natural state, and protect it, for the enjoyment and awe of many generations to come.I have visited four of the Monuments listed, each in a different state. Perhaps it is that I am a west coast resident and have been my entire life, that I feel the importance of preserving such places. Spending time in nature feeds everyones soul, it reenergizes them and connects them to this great land that our county is made up of. For those that have not been able to visit these monuments, or experienced this rejuvenation or connectedness to the land, we must protect these places in hopes that everyone will some day be able to visit and experience the humbling nature and awe that lands such as these inspire.

DOI-2017-0002-49378,"Our national monuments represent and are an expression of our national values. They represent the what our ancestors and people in History believed in, and endured in times of hardship. What having a dream, of Americans coming together as one united people and hope to strive for and achieve someday. They symbolize what people fought to live for, and also for what they died for. How people sacrificed everything for what they believed in, to show the future there is hope and to never give up. To instill loyalty and meaning in our country, and to never forget the history of how our laws and how our freedom came to be. If Trump decides to shrink or repeal them he will be removing what this country means to us as citizens, present and future. He believes in nothing, other than money. Money is his God, and he is loyal to no one but money and himself. He has no values no matter how rich he is. We shouldn't have to let go of of what this country and it's monuments stand for because he has no soul. If he really cares about America he should do for the people, and not just for the rich or his own agenda because this country and what it stood for is dying. Since hes come into office it seems that the country is only being held together by mere threads. Even his bombing of Syria didn't feel like a victory, and it is pitiful he and some of the Republicans were celebrating like it was. He only brings shame to this country and to the Government. If the Republicans plan to keep him in office, no matter what he does wrong to this country, Congress should at least help preserve and protect our monuments, so we can hold on to our faith, that Trumps tyrant reign will come to an end someday.Onishea Aguilera",No,Positive,https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=DOI-2017-0002-49378

DOI-2017-0002-51314,"The Bears Ears area was acquired as part of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo that ended the Mexican American War. The land was transferred to ownership by the United States government to be held in trust for the American people. The enabling act that brought Utah into the United States did NOT cede the lands in question to the state of Utah. They were retained in trust for the people of the United States. Congress has the authority to dispose of federal property. With the Antiquities Act congress delegated to the President the authority to permanently withdraw lands from development or disposition in the interest of conservation, science and archaeology. In effect this was an exercise of congressional power. It did not grant the executive branch the authority to rescind any designation made under the act. Designations made under the act have been recognized as one way actions since at least 1937.Efforts to preserve both the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase Escalante have been in process for at least the past 50 years. These lands were held in trust for ALL AMERICANS for at least the past 150 years. The monument designations protect the rights of local neighbors to continue to access the lands for recreation and multi use. Development of any of these lands would eventually result in loss of access for local neighbors. SD Governor Peter Norbeck recognized this risk and established Custer State Park to assure recreational access for state residents. Today this park is extremely popular and generates millions of dollars in economic activity for the citizens of Western South Dakota. The Bears Ears and Grand Staircase Escalante will have the same impact for the residents of Garfield, Kane and San Juan County Utah. This development as monuments have already generated permanent benefits to the neighboring communities. Preservation of special places is good for the soul of our country and has also been shown to be good for business. Tourism and recreation jobs are permanent jobs that bring broad community benefits for all. My wife and I are planning a visit to these monuments next year.As a psychiatric nurse practitioner I prescribe outdoor activities to help treat the symptoms of mental illness.

Grand Staircase-Escalante is so stunning that I have decided to buy property nearby so that I can explore more and more of it, and it also protects some of the greatest palentological discoveries in the nation. Vermillion Cliffs is a wild treasure that has brought a great many visitors and economic development within the region (Paria River/Buckskin Gulch and Coyote Buttes North/South have drawn worldwide attention.) Bear's Ears was carefully crafted with local economic concerns in mind and with the input and collaboration of affected tribes. Each of these monuments was enacted after a painstaking public comment period. The executive order caters only to a small minority of people who want this land for their own economic benefit, instead of the economic health of the surrounding communities and the enjoyment of millions of people from all over the world. Resource extraction would forever mar these beautiful areas and would mean tourism would be permanently harmed, including after mines are closed and wells are capped. Revoking monument designations would be a massive mistake and would result in a short term gain for some, and permanent damage to area economies. For example, I stated that I am looking to buy property, with plans on building a home near Grand Staircase-Escalante. That represents new money in the region.

Attempts to roll back protections for national monuments would be both illegal and terribly misguided and I strongly urge you to oppose any efforts to eliminate or shrink our national monuments.Bears Ears National Monument in Utah, which is first on the list for this review, is a textbook example of the priceless historic, cultural and natural wonders that are protected as National Monuments. Protecting 100,000 archaeological and cultural sites as well as stunning mesas, canyons and arches and the incredible outdoor recreation, hunting, fishing and general solitude and peace they contain, these treasures are irreplaceable. The designation and boundaries of the monument honors the voices of five sovereign tribal nations who joined together to seek protection of their shared ancestral lands and traditions, Bears Ears National Monument should remain protected permanently.Additionally, an attempt to attack one monument by rolling back protections would be an attack on them all. Sending a signal that protections for our shared history and culture are not permanent would set a terrible precedent. This would discourage business investment and community growth around all national monuments while also sending the signal that our history and natural wonders are negotiable.

We would spend money in local grocery stores, eat in restaurants, and then my personal souvenir has always been a piece of art by a local artist in a surrounding community. These monuments provide a tangible piece of the Western landscape that we can never recover if we don't protect them from development. Oil and gas industries make promises about environmental protections that they never keep and the land is forever scarred. Habitat for desert birds, reptiles, mammals, and insects is precious, and the acreage of these monuments seems vast but is a drop in the bucket compared to the ranges these animals require in migratory corridors or in search of water and food. Take the case of Boulder, Utah- there's sustainable business around the outdoor industry, and in Colorado (Leadville-eg Melanzana) is another example of how entrepreneurs can make sustainable businesses in rural places that do not rely on extraction industries. Ranchers are a special case in which we want to preserve their livelihoods and we could do so without rescinding the monuments-that is a better route than to allow oil and gas to dictate the fate of the land. Additionally, the Southern Ute tribes endorse this monument as it preserves their access to cultural significant sites and practices. Don't let big business trample our national treasures. More so than than an exhibit in a museum, the Bear Ears and Grand-Staircase Escalante monuments are a window into the past and future landscapes of the West. Let's keep it that way, conserved and preserved in perpetuity. Thank you,Claire Bensard",Yes,Positive,https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=DOI-2017-0002-6313

DOI-2017-0002-77394,"This comment is in reference to the central Dark Canyon, Bears Ears Buttes and Cedar Mesa region:One of the primary criteria for establishing National Monuments is to protect ""objects of scientific interest"" and one of the primary goals of Bears Ears was to protect paleontological and archaeological resources. All of its areas contain world class vertebrate fossil localities spanning the Pennsylvanian through the Cretaceous, many of them only just beginning to be prospected. Many of the fossils from Bears Ears are only examples of their kind in the country or the world, including new species of extinct fish, amphibians, mammal-relatives, and reptiles. Designation of the monument was a major accomplishment for our science and we do not want to lose it.The central Dark Canyon, Bears Ears Buttes and Cedar Mesa region contains scientifically invaluable Pennsylvanian and Permian communities that document the history of terrestrial vertebrate life prior to the Permian-Triassic extinction. The area includes spectacular synapsid remains and strange burrows from these early mammal relatives that are still poorly understood. Losing protections would hinder research.The Valley of the Gods area includes some of the earliest vertebrates to walk on land in America, as well as exquisitely preserved leaf fossils and petrified wood. Fossil evidence exposed along the Honaker Trail provides evidence that this arid landscape was once part of a thriving coral reef during the Pennsylvanian Period. The Red Canyon Region preserves one of the best records of the Triassic-Jurassic transition anywhere in the world, providing crucial information for paleontologists seeking to understand how dinosaurs came to dominate terrestrial ecosystems during the Mesozoic Era. This area has only just begun to be prospected and already it has produced an incredible range of vertebrate life, including enigmatic animals like the armored Doswellia. Only parts of the Red Canyon Region are currently protected within the boundaries of the Monument. It would be pertinent to expand the boundaries to include the area between the western ""island"" and the main part of the Monument.The Indian Creek Region documents the ecology of large carnivorous mastodontosaouroids in the Moenkopi Fm., and the geologically younger Chinle Fm. has produced fossil plants, crayfish and burrows, and extinct amphibians and reptiles, such as metoposaurs, phytosaurs, crocodylomorphs, and dinosaurs. Sites in this area were looted before the Monument was established.The Eastern Region of the Monument has a unique record of Jurassic and Cretaceous vertebrate life, including many new dinosaur taxa like the prosauropod Seitaad.In summary, this national monument is important for protecting irreplaceable scientific resources, in addition to being a place of beauty that should be protected for public enjoyment.

DOI-2017-0002-79767,"To the point, the national parks and monuments in southeastern Utah are unique and fragile landscapes unlike anything elsewhere. I grew up in Utah (now living in Massachusetts) and came of age hiking and camping in Escalante, Canyonlands, and areas now within Bears Ears. This is high desert with sandstone sculptured canyons and most vegetation confined to streambeds coming from high peaks and plateaus. Fabulous, but rugged terrain and my friends here in Boston are intrigued with visiting these unique areas. I know Utah politicians want to exploit these lands, mainly mineral and gas extraction. Fracking is not viable here because of the rugged terrain and lack of water makes costs extremely high. There is coal on the Kapairowitz plateau, but getting coal out of this rugged area costs more than coal is worth, particularly in this time of natural gas prices and climate change concerns. The new monument boundaries contain school trust lands, which locks out the state from any access or development. One option is a land swap with federal land outside the monument boundaries. Another option is that states share in revenue generated from entrance fees, camping, and guided tours within the monument. This revenue is sustainable and long-term will generate more gains than a one-shot well or mine that leaves a permanent scar on the landscape. In closing, I am very pleased with Grand Staircase - Escalante and new Bears Ears monuments. These lands are worthy of protection of antiquities and natural environment.

As a private citizen, I greatly appreciate the role the national government has played in preserving pieces of land, which provide valuable recreational opportunities for many Americans. Historically, these areas have been important to those who love the outdoors and even, more tangibly, for local economies and other economic and societal benefits. As a research scientist with concerns about the conservation of important ecosystems and many flora and fauna (including endangered varieties), I also believe establishing National Monuments is an important conservation tool that will allow priceless resources to be preserved for the good of ecosystems and the environment, and for the enjoyment of future generations. The tradeoff of active development and economic interests, and debate over land-use policy on public lands, while important, should be cast aside when considering the establishment of many of these National Monuments, which normally exist in remote areas of natural beauty and deserve protection.In conclusion, I believe these and all National Monuments are important and should be retained as public lands by the US Government. Moreover, policies already exist to formalize the process of declaring National Monuments and I find a post hoc review process to be frustrating as a citizen and wasteful as a taxpayer.

As a long time visitor, hiking, exploring and off-roading in the Gold Butte area I feel I have to be among the few, it seems, that does not fully agree with the designation of Gold Butte National Monument and all the hoop-la that is being touted. I for one was satisfied with the Gold Butte designation before (area of critical environmental concern) as it was relatively free of visitors but somewhat protected. Now that will change drastically. As far as adequate protection to the cultural resources - that is where BLM management failed. It had an obligation before the designation to protect these resources. Making it a monument will not make it immune to further damage. With a large increase in visitation damage will go up.Also, making Gold Butte a NM will vastly increase the number of recreational visitors and these visitors won't be happy to find that roads are not really there to provide this visitation advertised. They will expect good roads, upgraded campgrounds and interpretive signs. Mega dollars will be needed to bring Gold Butte to the standard (roads, toilets, road signs and improved camp sites) that has been advertised by various groups such as FofGB that have advocated for all those Mesquite tourist dollarsMy recommendation is to make the ""very sensitive areas"" in Gold Butte a National Monument which would be around 50,000 acres. Given the cultural sensitivity of these 50K acres a higher level of protection would suffice and then leave the rest of Gold Butte as is (area of critical environmental concern). Cost much less and would be smaller area to patrol.The U.S. Geological Survey was tasked to do a mineral survey of an area within Gold Butt called Million Hills Wilderness Study Area (21,296 acres).

I will do my best to keep my passionate thoughts on this matter brief, so that you have time to listen to others' opinions as well.I was born in 1971, in upstate NY, within the 6.1 million acres of the Adirondack Park, to a NY State DEC Forest Ranger and a school secretary. My backyard was forest, and my fence was ""stay within yelling range."" My entire youth, my brother and I learned from our father to appreciate, respect, understand, and honor our planet, because it was our back yard. It was part of our home. I had no idea at that young age how fortunate I was.Later in life, when I entered college, I met people from ""The City."" I would see looks in new friends' eyes from awe and jealousy, to ""you crazy, girl"" when I would tell tales of jumping in lakes under the moonlight, catching snakes and bugs, ice skating on frozen ponds, and packing a lunch to hike out solo as far as I dared go until I got scared that I was ""out of yelling distance,"" and would come running home. I understood the stars, which many new classmates had never seen through the light pollution of their cities. I did not need a watch to read the time, as I understood the path of the sun. I knew the campus squirrels, raccoons, and skunks were not to be feared, but some had never seen them before. I could identify sounds of insects and birds, where others only heard neighbors yell and cars screech their wheels outside their bedroom windows. I took it upon myself to bring my new friends home. I took them on hikes and horseback rides, we swam in lakes, and we slept in tents. No, ""the outdoors"" wasn't and isn't for everyone, but everyone deserves a chance to make that decision for themselves. For too many Americans, there IS no backyard. Endorsing the National Monuments, Parks, and protected forests is the only chance for Americans of every age to learn to not only appreciate our resources, but to conserve them, because you fight for what you love. If it is important to you, you will take care of it and protect it. These lands are not goods for purchase. When these lands are diminished or used up, we can't get new ones or recycle them.

Bears Ears is exactly the kind of place the Antiquities Act intended to protect. It is rich in cultural history which inspired a historic coalition of tribes to band together to push for its designation. In addition to protecting over 100,000 archaeological sites, the designation preserves world-class recreation opportunities in places like Cedar Mesa, Grand Gulch, and Indian Creek. The process that led to the designation of Bears Ears National Monument was thorough and transparent. For more than 80 years, decision makers from all sides presented proposals seeking permanent protection of all or part of this incredible landscape. The boundaries were informed by both the multi-year Public Lands Initiative and by a proposal from the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition. Those boundaries do not exceed the acreage necessary to preserve the rich cultural heritage, ecological values, and recreation assets.

I support the Bears Ears National Monument and strongly urge you to uphold the monument's current boundaries.Bears Ears is a sacred landscape with more than 100,000 Native American cultural sites.

Bears Ears is also home to scientific wonders, irreplaceable wildlife and biodiversity and recreational opportunities that form a vital base to the local economy. That is why Utahns and Americans across the country like me have agreed it should be protected for future generations.This designation received an enormous amount of careful consideration, including years of listening to stakeholders. Dozens of community meetings and public discussions were held throughout 2016, including a well-attended public meeting with then-Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell in Bluff, Utah. The final monument designation boundaries are very close to what was proposed in the Utah delegation's Public Lands Initiative (PLI), and much smaller (550,000 acres) than the Tribally-led proposal.

Our HUMAN NEED for open space and nature, while not always consciously felt, is strong - we de-stress, we heal. we open ourselves up when out in nature and our minds are cleared while our bodies get supercharged with fresh air, and renewed vigor. We need these wild places to remain wild, to know that somewhere, the animals and birds and plants are thriving, even if we don't visit those places. We need to know that there are places in our crowded world where we can get away from it all, the crowds, the technology, the buzz of daily life, and trade it in for the buzz of bees and the trickle of streams, when we feel the urge. Not everyone realizes this, but it's an inherent part of our nature as animals to know we have an 'escape route', a safe zone, even if we never use it.More and more, our government is cow-towing to the 'needs' of businesses that will profit while putting our environment at risk. Companies that ignore the value of open spaces, wild spaces, and the wildlife within, for the almighty dollar that the extractions will bring. These monuments deserve to remain protected; many are buffer zones to the extraction that is going on just outside their borders. They provide the buffer zone and attempt to preserve migration routes and the large territory that many wild animals need to survive, let alone thrive. I have spent time in many of these places, and each time I come away refueled with a vigor; much like the negative ions that surround cascading waterfalls and how they positively affect us, the wilderness as a whole does as much, and I implore you to consider saving these monumental areas as the deserved monuments they are.",No,Positive,https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=DOI-2017-0002-48775

DOI-2017-0002-4735,"As a member of the American Motorcyclist Association and an off-highway vehicle recreation enthusiast, I applaud the U.S. Department of the Interior for the opportunity to comment on its review of certain National Monuments designated or expanded since 1996 under the American Antiquities Act of 1906, to implement Executive Order 13792 of April 26.I, along with the AMA, support the review as a way to determine whether some monument designations included more land than necessary as defined by the Act. I also believe presidents should solicit input from the public before making such designations, even though the law does not require it.I oppose sweeping monument designations by administrations that fail to consider input from all stakeholders. Such designations can restrict or eliminate opportunities for responsible off-highway motorized recreation on public lands and negatively affect the economies of the communities surrounding the monuments.The Antiquities Act grants the president authority to designate national monuments to protect ""historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures and other objects of historic or scientific interest"" that are on federal lands. The law limits the size of the designations to ""the smallest area compatible with proper care and management of the objects to be protected.""Previous administrations have used the broadly defined stipulations of the Antiquities Act to create monument designations. Unfortunately, these broad designations have closed larger-than-necessary territories that were previously used for wholesome recreation, such as responsible motorized recreation that supports small business and local economies. The designation of National Monuments on public lands may reduce or end access for responsible motorized recreation. Designations can be made that will benefit all groups, as long as these groups are given the opportunity to contribute their perspectives.Excerpts from an AMA guest blog written by Clif Koontz address the Grand Staircase-Escalante, Canyons of the Ancients and Bears Ears National Monuments. Koontz is the executive director of Ride with Respect, a nonprofit organization based in Moab, Utah, that conserves shared-use recreation through trail work and education.Koontz states, ""The Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument closed half of the existing routes open to motorized recreation. The federal land managers even prohibited off-highway motorcyclists from riding the graded, gravel roads."" He added, ""Fortunately, the affected county asserted its jurisdiction over those roads, but not before having to fight the federal land managers in court.""At the Canyons of the Ancients National Monument, Koontz says, federal land managers first closed the single-track trails, then prohibited motorcycles from ""motorcycle trails"" that actually were roads for four-wheeled vehicles. Those roads are a far cry from the actual single-track trails they had closed to responsible recreation.""For the new Bears Ears National Monument, Koontz states, it ""encircles many 4WD roads, ATV trails and motorcycle trails where Ride with Respect has worked. ... If history is any guide, these routes will eventually be closed due to the national monument status, despite the fact that we've made them sustainable, not to mention that they avoid archaeological sites.""However, the AMA believes some previous monument designations go beyond the ""requirements and original objectives of the Act.""Moreover, these designations did not consider the multiple-use policy of section 102(a)(7) of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (43 U.S.C. 1701(1)(7)).The AMA and I support the protection of our national treasures by using a process that involves state officials, local stakeholders, governors and Congress.Again, I applaud the Interior Department for seeking public comments on its review of certain National Monuments.",Yes,Negative,https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=DOI-2017-0002-4735

DOI-2017-0002-20801,"1359 South Glenmare StreetSalt Lake City, UT 84105May 9, 2017The Honorable Ryan ZinkeSecretary of InteriorDepartment of the Interior.1849 C Street, N.W.Washington DC 20240Dear Mr. Secretary:Thank you for undertaking the important task of reviewing the status of various National Monuments in the United States. Two are of particular importance to those of us living in Utah: The Bears Ears National Monument and the Escalante Grand Staircase National Monument.Thank you for visiting Utah and consulting with various factions within Utah. But PLEASE review all relevant information before submitting your review. Please review and consider two full page ads in the Salt Lake Tribune on May 07, 2017 - one from the Tribal Governments of the Bears Ears area and one from Patagonia, Inc. which states that this area has more species diversity than Yellowstone National Park and more cultural and archeological sites than Canyon de Chelly National Monument - among other distinctions.Please review ALL of the surveys and polls taken on the subject of who wants the Monuments to remain as currently designated and those who want them scaled back or the designations removed altogether. I think you will find that the results of the surveys vary. Some polls will claim that most Utahans and most Native citizens WANT the designations and some polls will claim that a majority of both parties do NOT WANT the designations to remain. Consider the source of the polling organizations, and draw your own conclusions, but it is my firm impression that MOST Utahans and MOST Native Tribe Members WANT the full protection of the National Monument designation. Please do not rely solely on the inputs from Utah's Congressional Caucus and some of our very vocal local officials. They do NOT represent my views, and it is my firm conviction that they do NOT represent the interests of most of the affected Utahans. They will claim that the recent Bears Ears designation was a sneaky ""Midnight Monument"" designation. This is simply not true. Please see "" 'Midnight monument'? No, Utah leaders had years to make a Bears Ears deal"" by Terry Tempest Williams and Bill Hedden (Salt Lake Tribune, Dec 20 2016), ""Hatch doesn't tell the truth about Bears Ears"" by Harry Holland (Salt Lake Tribune, April 30, 2017), and ""Noel, crying wolf about federal reach, uses fiction to fit his message"" by Paul Rolly (Salt Lake Tribune, May 05, 2017) - among many other articles - for background information about the Monument designation history.Please do not fall prey to the demands of some vocal politicians and residents to ""return control of these lands to the State."" Control of these lands was NEVER in the hands of the State of Utah. The land was ""stolen fair and square"" from Mexico with the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848. The control of these lands was specifically maintained by the Federal Government as a condition of Utah statehood in the Enabling Act of 1894.Please do not be misled by fears of economic disaster if the Monuments are left in place. You may hear about the closure of a sawmill after the Escalante Grand Staircase National Monument designation, but it is my understanding that that particular sawmill never got ANY timber from the Monument area. You may hear about declining school enrollment in this area, but you should know that enrollments are decreasing in MOST rural Utah areas - with or without National Monument status. You will hear about the loss of coal and oil jobs in these areas, but it is my understanding that any commercial plans to extract coal or oil reserves in this area have been severely cut back. You may or may not hear much about the economic benefits of increased jobs in the tourism related industries in those areas. See ""What monument really means to Garfield County"" by Ira Pollock (Salt Lake Tribune, April 30, 2017) for the insight of an extended family living in Southern Utah.Mr. Secretary, you have an important and difficult task.

DOI-2017-0002-58608,"Dear Secretary Ryan Zinke,Please protect Bears Ears National Monument as well as all of our country's other important and meaningful national monuments. Experiences in the outdoors in places such as Grand Canyon, Black Canyon of the Gunnison, and the Colorado National Monument have shaped my life, as well as the lives of many others. Experiences in these protected places taught me lessons of caring for the natural world, and allowed me to connect with family and friends in a deep and meaningful way that one just doesn't get in everyday life. These places are incredible natural resources that deserve to remain protected. I would like to urge the Department of the Interior to protect the integrity of the Antiquities Act, which has been used by Presidents of both parties for over 100 years to initially protect such places as the Grand Canyon AZ, Black Canyon of the Gunnison CO, Zion UT, Olympic WA, Capitol Reef UT, Grand Teton WY, Aniakchak AK, and Denali AK. Outdoor recreation in these national monuments is important for several reasons. It is good for one's physical and mental health to connect with the outdoors, I always return from adventures feeling invigorated and refreshed, ready to tackle life's challenges. The personal connections made in the outdoors are deep and personal ones, I have a great relationship with my dad forged over many adventures and experiences in the outdoors that I otherwise would not have, not to mention the countless new friends I have made along the way. I often get to know someone better in one day on a river than someone I may have known for many years. Probably the most important factor in protecting natural wonders like national monuments is fostering the love of the outdoors and the physical and mental well being in the next generation. I love seeing young kids' eyes light up when they get outside and experience something new. As people and communities become less active and more isolated from each other, it is now more important than ever that young generations get out and move their bodies, inspire themselves, learn about the natural world, and connect with others. The public decision making process of the Antiquities Act that protects these places was put in place for a reason, to protect ourselves from ourselves. Please consider the public decision making process and protections that were put in place to protect these areas, before stripping these protections. The enjoyment and positive benefits people experience from enjoying these public places are a tangible benefit, that is just as meaningful as the financial bottom line. The longstanding history and support for protection of areas should not just be changed in the blink of an eye.

As a United States citizen a father and a grandfather, I do not support changing that now. It is my opinion that the current administration's primary interest in doing this is to move towards making this sites available for development and natural resources extraction. It is true that not every American or visitor to this country will get to see or wants to see these precious monuments, but for those of us who have visited even one of them, the results can be life changing. This is part of our culture and many of us cherish trips to these unique and awesome places and it is an adventure of a lifetime. I think one of the beautiful things about our culture is the diversity of the lands we live on and the awe inspiring national monuments that decorate our map and offer a getaway that is unique and apart from a trip to a city or amusement park or golf course. The San Juan Island National Monument, the Hanford Reach National Monument, Cascade Siskiyou National Monument and the WWII Valor are relatively local to me and are all places that should be left alone, to the people. I have also visited Red Pockets national Monument, Ironwood National Monument, the Giant Sequoia National Monument and the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. These are some of the strongest memories of my life and I look forward to those places being there, as they are, for many generations to come. We must also consider that the lands designated for this type of protection help preserve important and highly valuable ecosystems and ecosystem functions in a world that wreaking havoc on these systems at an exponential rate. Lastly, specific to Bears Ears, I applaud the work of the previous administration and acknowledgement of indigenous people, specifically the Dine, Ute, Hopi and Zuni people and their long standing connections to these lands. The excuse that these are sites where archeological thieves pray upon or vandals disrespect is not justification to rescind the Bears Ears National Monument. We also should not rescind this based on issues and attitudes certain politicians have towards the Obama administration. These monuments and the generations to come will long outlive their careers. Our nation owes a degree of respect to the indigenous people of these lands and preserving a National Monument that has many sacred sites and historical attachments within in it is but a small gesture towards that effort. It is ok for a nation to preserve some of our amazing national treasures and make them available to the people. There is much more to life than deal making, natural resource extraction and land development, and it seems like this Executive Order and process only seeks to serve special interests who involve themselves in that business.

DOI-2017-0002-7104,"Dear Secretary Zinke,I oppose rescinding, or changing the boundaries of, any existing national monuments.I am disappointed and concerned that the Executive Order to review all national monuments created since 1996 threatens Bears Ears in Utah. Bears Ears is exactly the landscape and resting place of innumerable antiquities that the Antiquities Act - a law that has been used by 16 Presidents of both parties to safeguard this and other national treasures - was enacted to protect. Rescinding the Bears Ears National Monument would be unprecedented.On the Department of Interior web page Secretary Zinke states: ""Most importantly, our sovereign Indian Nations and territories must have the respect and freedom they deserve."" Bears Ears is landscape sacred to a multitude of Native American tribes, and encompassing more than 100,000 Native American cultural sites. The proposal to establish it is unique among national monuments, in that it was developed by a coalition of five sovereign Tribal Governments (Hopi, Navajo, Ute Mountain Ute, Ute, and Zuni). Will you show that you have true respect for the people of ""sovereign Indian Nations"" and honor what amounts to an agreement between the Bears Ears coalition and the U.S. Government, and allow Bears Ears Monument to stand as it was created? Or will the establishment of Bear Ears Monument be yet another agreement with Native Americans that is broken by the U.S. Government, facilitated by you through a recommendation to President Trump to try to rescind, or alter the boundaries of, the Bears Ears Monument? I strongly urge you to choose the respect you proclaim to have for Native Americans and recommend that the Bears Ears Monument be maintained with it's existing boundaries. If anything, the monument is not big enough. The Tribes had requested almost 600,000 more acres for protection.Bears Ears is also home to scientific wonders, irreplaceable wildlife and biodiversity, and recreational opportunities that contribute substantially to the local economy. Opinion polls of Utah residents, as well as the broader American public, indicate that the majority agree the Bears Ears area should be protected for future generations and that the best way to accomplish this is to retain the area as a national monument. This designation received an enormous amount of scrutiny, including years of debate and discussion. Many community meetings and public discussions occurred throughout 2016. This included a very well attended public meeting in Bluff, UT with then-Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell. I know it was well attended, because I traveled from Flagstaff to Bluff to participate in that meeting. There were over 1,400 of us there, and it was clear - from the number of light blue, pro-monument t-shirts compared to the brown, anti-monument t-shirts - that those in favor of national monument status outnumbered those opposed to the monument. The final monument designation boundaries are very close to what was proposed in the Utah delegation's Public Lands Initiative (PLI), and much smaller than the Tribally-led proposal. This reduction in the initially proposed boundaries is a clear indication of the willingness to compromise in protecting the cultural and natural resources of the region, while still allowing for the possibility of alternate, extractive activities. Please leave Bears Ears National Monument's boundaries intact so that future generations will be able to explore, enjoy, and learn from this national treasure.In addition to recommending protection for the Bears Ears National Monument, I strongly urge you to recommend retaining the current boundaries of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National MonumentGrand Staircase-Escalante was designated in 1996. Since then, it has come to be known as the ""Science Monument""yielding several new species of dinosaur and other paleontological finds and providing habitat for 650 bee species, many that are endemic to the area. Grand Staircase-Escalante has world-class camping, hiking and other recreational opportunities. Places like Spooky Canyon, Coyote Gulch, and the Hole in the Rock Road are known the world over, and attracts thousands of visitors from around the globe. These visitors provide a huge infusion of dollars into the local economies in, and around, Grand Staircase-Escalante.As with the Bears Ears, public opinion polls shows more than half of Utahans want Grand Staircase-Escalante retained as a national monument, with the current boundaries. In addition, more than 80 percent of Westerners that the Colorado College Conservation in the West poll showed they want existing national monuments left intact. I retired to the Southwest two years ago specifically to enjoy the natural and cultural resources of these landscapes, including those in the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante areas.Again, I strongly oppose rescinding, or changing the boundaries of, any existing national monuments.Thank you.",Yes,Positive,https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=DOI-2017-0002-7104

DOI-2017-0002-24439,"I respectfully submit these comments as a member of the Society for American Archaeology in support of the __Bears Ears________________ National Monument. The Antiquities Act itself is the result of advocacy by the public and archaeologists concerned about the preservation of the cultural heritage contained in our federal lands. It is for the continued protection of cultural resources--specifically those located within the ___Bears Ears_________ Monument--that I am writing. The _____Bears Ears___________ Monument, which is subject to the review procedure outlined in the Executive Order (E.O.) signed by President Trump on April 26th, contains many known archaeological sites. There are likely even more as-yet unknown sites as portions of the land have never been surveyed to locate archaeological resources. In addition to playing active roles in the cultural lives of many people today, the historic and scientific value of these places and the objects they contain cannot be overstated. They are physical ties to the past, and hold irreplaceable information about the peoples who came before us, how they lived, and how they adapted--or not--to the ever-changing natural and social environments surrounding them. If these sites are looted or destroyed, those connections, and that data, are lost forever.Some are questioning the size of recent monument designations, given that the Antiquities Act states that monument boundaries should be limited to the smallest area compatible with effective management of the assets to be protected. As far as cultural resource protection is concerned, it is important to note that the science of archaeology has evolved greatly since the time the Act was signed. We've come to recognize that archaeological sites are best interpreted as part of the landscapes that surround them. It is only from this perspective that we can gain the clearest understanding of the lives of our forebears. I understand that preserving every acre of federal land from development is clearly neither possible nor even desirable. Setting aside lands containing the most sensitive cultural values, however, is vital to the continued growth of our knowledge of the past, without which the nation's future will be greatly diminished. It is possible to achieve both outcomes. Designation of land as a monument does not have to completely preclude economic development within its boundaries. Some activities compatible with resource preservation could take place, while still giving archaeological sites a higher level of protection than is afforded on lands outside monuments.

To be clear, I do not support this review and would argue that if any changes are to be proposed to the existing boundaries of the current National Monuments under review, they should be expanded, not reduced.The premise for this review was partly based upon the falsehood that sufficient public input was not garnered prior the designation of each National Monument. The process for designating a National Monument is anything but expeditious, taking into account input from the public both near and far to each monument and all levels of government, from local to State-wide offices. The idea that none of these monuments were designated without sufficient input is laughable at best and hints at ulterior motives behind this review. Each of these public lands presents a valuable treasure to be safeguarded in trust by the Department of Interior. And their value does not lie with what is found beneath the soils or sediments but in what each of these areas represents. Each of these monuments highlights one of the greatest and original American ideas--that land on this Earth can be preserved for all to share and enjoy, both current and future generations. Furthermore, as you recently highlighted, National Monuments are the foundation that makes the thriving outdoor recreation industry possible. An industry that generates ""$887 billion in consumer spending every year and supports more jobs (7.6 million) than oil, natural gas and mining combined"". If preserving these lands for the use of the public is not a sufficient reason to safeguard the existing boundaries of each National Monument, then consider the overall economic benefit each Monument provides.I sincerely hope that the voices of each and every individual are considered during your review.

DOI-2017-0002-48343,"As an outdoor enthusiast who loves our public lands, I support the designation of Bears Ears National Monument and ask that its boundaries remain unchanged.For more than 100 years, Presidents of both parties have used the Antiquities Act-a tool signed into law by Theodore Roosevelt-to enact far-sighted protections for our common American inheritance. Bears Ears is exactly the kind of place the Antiquities Act intended to protect. It is rich in cultural history which inspired a historic coalition of tribes to band together to push for its designation. In addition to protecting over 100,000 archaeological sites, the designation preserves world-class recreation opportunities in places like Cedar Mesa, Grand Gulch, and Indian Creek. The process that led to the designation of Bears Ears National Monument was thorough and transparent. For more than 80 years, decision makers from all sides presented proposals seeking permanent protection of all or part of this incredible landscape. The boundaries were informed by both the multi-year Public Lands Initiative and by a proposal from the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition. Those boundaries do not exceed the acreage necessary to preserve the rich cultural heritage, ecological values, and recreation assets. Thank you for reviewing the decades of hard work and thoughtful consideration that culminated in the designation of Bears Ears National Monument. Please recommend that President Trump leave the current Bears Ears National Monument boundaries in place.I'm also asking you to take to social media to spread the word.",Yes,Positive,https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=DOI-2017-0002-48343

I have been blessed to walk these sacred places and to have been deeply moved by the grandeur of these lonely lands. Camping in Mikes Canyon with a full moon remains one of the most memorable nights of my life. It has been a humbling experience to Introduce visitors from the eastern United States to the beauty of Cedar Mesa and the rich heritage of the original people who made their home in so many places like Owl Canyon. The Abajos, Bears Ears, Combs Ridge--these are places that have shaped me as a person and made me proud to be an American. As a father, it has been a joy to see some of these places anew through the eyes of my daughter, who now holds the landscape as her personal heritage and responsibility. Any visitor to these lands who is willing to open their heart to them will be moved by their stark majesty and feel the call to take responsibility for their preservation. The indigenous cultures that are at home in these lands deserve the protection of these places as both spiritual homes and places to practice their cultural ways. How insulting to question the designation of this monument following an inclusive and thorough review of the proposal. This should be an example America takes pride in rather than something the Trump Administration and Secretary Zinke are questioning. That is shameful. Giant Sequoia National Monument, like all of the monuments on this ridiculous list of protected areas under review, was established to provide the protection that trees, streams, and wildlife were not receiving as part of Sequoia National Forest. I have spent a lot of time in this area and have witnessed first hand the damage that the Forest Service has done to the Giant Sequoia groves and other areas of these fragile and beautiful lands over the decades. Finally, with the monument designation, these giant trees and the ecosystem they crown can finally get the protection and care they need.San Gabriels National Monument is another monument I am deeply familiar with. The lands of the Angeles National Forest are directly adjacent to one of the world's great population centers--the Los Angeles metropolitan area--as well as one of its most diverse. Despite years of effort to get the Forest Service to manage the San Gabriels for the the conservation of its unique and diverse ecoystems while encouraging recreation by under-served and under-represented populations, it took a monument designation to begin in earnest the work of managing these lands for their highest and best purposes. A broad community of interests came together in support of this monument, which should be held up as a model for the 21st mission of our public lands rather than subjected to this waste of taxpayer dollars to ""review"" its worthiness or appropriateness as a monument.In sum, these three specific monuments and the others under review were the result of years of careful work by folks in the communities in and around the monuments as well as the Americans in all 50 states who hold our federal lands in a trust that distinguishes our country from any other. I urge Secretary Zinke and President Trump to leave these monuments alone, to support them to realize the vision that inspired each of them, and to stop expecting every acre of land to somehow pencil out on a balance sheet.

Connecting Joshua Tree National Park to the Mojave National Preserve, Mojave Trails National Monument plays an important role as a wildlife corridor for species such as the desert bighorn sheep and desert tortoise, while containing a diverse array of life in and of itself. Alongside 12 adjacent public land areas, Mojave Trails National Monument is a significant part of the second largest desert preserve on the globe. Each of these public land components is thus important to the protection of the whole. Meanwhile, the landscape provides a stunning experience for tourists passing through. Mojave Trails is geologically significant, containing cinder cone volcanoes and multiple mountain ranges that stand stark against the desert landscape, in addition to fossil beds containing half-billion-year-old trilobites. The Pisgah Lava Flow in particular is a leading location for research on the effects of volcanic activity on evolution. Mojave Trails also contains unique cultural and archeological sites such as indigenous trade routes and trails. Throughout this landscape in the National Monument winds an authentic and undeveloped stretch of historic Route 66. Put simply, this landscape is the American Southwest at its best.Secretary Zinke is also instructed to review Monuments in part based on ""concerns of State, tribal, and local governments affected by a designation, including the economic development and fiscal condition of affected States, tribes, and localities."" The Ward Valley region of the National Monument is sacred to the Colorado River Indian Tribes. A quarter of a million acres of the monument were donated by the Wildlife Conservancy for the express purpose of federal protection, the largest private land gift in the history of the United States. These stakeholders deserve priority consideration in the monument's future. The longtime support of US Senator Dianne Feinstein is also notable, from the elevation of nearby Death Valley and Joshua Tree National Monuments to National Parks in the mid-1990s to requesting that President Obama's preserve Mojave Trails. The president of KEEN stated recently that Mojave Trails is ""exactly the kind of place the Antiquities Act intended to protect. It is rich in cultural history, archeological sites, and recreation opportunities...that benefit all Americans."" 3.2 million people visit the public lands surrounding Mojave Trails annually, providing 2,700 jobs and $200 million to the local economy. The preservation of Mojave Trails National Monument in the center it all will support further tourism growth in the area: a local resort employee writes that such National Monuments are ""a boon to our local economies and emblems of our local heritage"" (http://www.sbsun.com/opinion/20170510/efforts-to-shrink-eliminate-national-monuments-will-hurt-economy-guest-commentary). An entrepreneur and a venture capitalist note the importance of public lands for attracting top-notch talent and point out a recent study showing ""that communities in the American West have $4.360 higher per capita income for every 100,000 acres of protected public lands,"" Donald Trump Jr., who stated that our public lands are ""about being able to get in there and enjoy the outdoors and enjoy those great traditions that are...so much the foundation of America...and making sure that those lands are maintained properly; making sure they're not going into private hands to be effectively walled off to the general public"" (http://www.mercurynews.com/2016/12/28/opinion-national-monuments-drive-economic-growth/). Secretary Zinke is further directed to consider ""that reservations of land not exceed the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management..."". As Mojave Trails is the keystone of the California desert's protected lands, no acreage can be sacrificed without adverse consequences. President Obama's 2016 proclamation to establish the National Monument (https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/02/12/presidential-proclamation-establishment-mojave-trails-national-monument) makes clear the extensive research underlying the decision to protect this land and the value lying in every acre.Mojave Trails National Monument is a place of stunning beauty, a site of archeological, ecological, and geological significance, and an indispensable component of the California desert public lands.

Rescinding the status of national monuments, decreasing their size, or weakening their regulations reneges on our federal government's conservation commitments to these federal lands. Rescinding the national monument status of Bears Ears National Monument, or any of our other national monuments, would be a grave and unprecedented intervention in federal lands management, the legality of which will certainly be questioned. In the case of Bears Ears National Monument it is important to honor President Obama's national monument dedication as a promise made by the government of the United States to five American Indian tribes -- the Hopi Tribe, the Navajo Nation, the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe, the Pueblo of Zuni, and the Ute Indian Tribe. Bear Ears National Monument is unique as the first example of a federally protected area established at the request of an American Indian tribe. It is also the first to have a Native American advisory committee, the Bears Ear Commission.

DOI-2017-0002-75156,"Dear Secretary Ryan Zinke,As a native of Colorado and an advocate for the West and Southwestern United States, it is truly devastating to have to write this message, begging for these monuments to stay protected. These monuments were declared to protect special and unique archaeological and geographical areas in our large country to preserve their story and beauty for generations to come. I live in Colorado and Canyons of the Ancients National Monument is under consideration for review. This is completely devastating. This National Monument is a significant piece of Colorado and the Southwest. This monument has the largest concentration of archaeological sites in teh United States, including Mesa Verda - a major tourist and outdoor recreational site for visitors to Colorado and the Southwest. Going to Canyons of the Ancients National Monument and Mesa Verde has been a staple of my childhood and adult life and I would like it to still be there when I have children. And the same goes for the other monuments up for review. Outdoor recreation is a major source of funding and tourism for all the states with monuments under review. It would be a huge blow to these states and communities to have the monuments revoked. Having protected places to go is hugely important. Removing the National Monument designation is just wrong and bad for these communities' economies. As a avid outdoor recreationalist, National Monuments are integral elements in my travel plans and vacations. Additionally, these monument designations go through rigorous vetting processes so to just reverse the designations is a slap in the face of the process and the public's involvement in the declaration of a monument. I am urging the Department of the Interior to uphold all these National Monument designations for the good of the country, the states, and the communities that service the millions that visit these places every year.

Both US Senators for Maine, Susan Collins and Angus King, have spoken up in favor of the National Monument, and they as well as Maine State Legislators Jim Dill, Michael Carpenter, and Stephen Stanley from the Katahdin region, elected officials from the surrounding area including Millinocket, Medway, Patten, and Sherman, and the Katahdin Area and Bangor Region Chambers of Commerce all oppose removing the National Monument's status.

DOI-2017-0002-54134,"Secretary Zinke;I reserve the right to make further comments on the pending and almost certainly illegal review of 27 National Monuments designated under the Antiquities Act of 1908. But for now: This short timetable for comments is both unprecedented and ridiculously antidemocratic. While it's true that no law mandates a set comment period for a review such as this because the review itself is not authorized by any law, simple human decency and respect for American traditions demand an extension of the comment period to at least 90 days. The declaration that you will not consider comments submitted before the Federal Register publication of the Notice of Opportunity for Public Comment is unnecessary, and an insult to members of the public who cared enough to comment despite an understandable unfamiliarity with the arbitrary timetable of this unprecedented and legally unauthorized review. The Antiquities Act of 1908 has been invoked by almost all presidents of both parties since it was made law. It has been part of the American tradition for 109 years. In the last 20 years, the Act has mainly been used to designate protected land because Congress has consistently blocked initiatives to protect the land by legislative means, because legislators who represent a minority of Americans have chosen not to listen to the overwhelming majority of Americans who want land protected. An overwhelming majority of Americans support each and every monument being called up for ""review."" Opposition by local entrenched politicians, as in Utah, does not equal public opposition. The President and Interior Department have no legal authority to ""review"" Antiquities Act monuments. You are opening the Interior Department up to perhaps dozens of costly lawsuits. Interior will lose those lawsuits. The Trump administration charges that former Presidents may have abused the Antiquities Act by protecting entire landscapes instead of small historical sites. But that argument has already been rejected by the DC Circuit Court of Appeals in 2002, when it ruled in favor of several National Monuments in the case Mountain States Legal Foundation v. Bush. The DC Circuit found that nothing in the Antiquities Act limited a President's power to use the law to protect whole ecosystems. Mountain States, which wanted six monuments overturned, appealed to the Supreme Court, but SCOTUS decided the case was so meritless it didn't even want to hear arguments. The issue has already been decided by the highest court in the land.The Executive Order compelling this review is a politically driven whim penned by a president unfamiliar with public lands law, environmental law, or the American traditions of democracy. Halting this legally untenable process will not salvage Donald Trump's reputation or historic legacy, but it may help protect your own.As mentioned above, I reserve the right to submit additional comments.

These lands highlight and preserve a multitude of important cultural, historical and ecological structures and processes that can be enjoyed by future generations. Specifically relating to Bears Ears National Monument and the criteria set forth in this review.1. I argue that this monument should have been bigger to encompass more of the area of great cultural significance to the Navajo, Ute, and Pueblo. This is an area of incredible prehistoric human settlements that all Americans (and international tourists) can learn from and enjoy.2. Bears Ears preserves a landscape where there are physical remnants of 12,000 years of civilization. This quite clearly is appropriately classified as a monument preserving prehistoric structures of interest.3. The management of the area called Bears Ears is not greatly changed with monument designation. Grazing permits remain in effect, very little oil or gas drilling was done in the area, but whatever permits existed, are grandfathered in. I would argue that more money will come to the area in the form of tourism dollars, since monument status brings in more people.4. There are many inholdings in national monuments, parks and forests across the United States. Due to the fact that all of the land designated as Bears Ears was already federally managed, there should not be any change for those that had inholdings.5. Although state politicians seem particularly against Bears Ears, it has a large amount of local public support and is one of the first monuments where local tribes actively sought to create and manage it. The local tourism economy will be improved with this monument.6. The US government can choose whether it funds all of the land it manages adequately through the budget process in Congress. If it chooses not to provide the appropriate level of resources for a given monument, that is not the fault of monument itself, that is the fault of Congress.In summary, I strongly support the federal government continuing to manage Bears Ears National Monument and all of the other monuments up for review with this executive order.Thank you.",Yes,Positive,https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=DOI-2017-0002-11375

I'm concerned about the rights of average Americans, and the viability of ecosystems that we rely on.Department of the Interior: please do not roll back protections for National Monuments.

DOI-2017-0002-78403,"Thank you for taking public comments, I'm very encouraged by Secretary Zinke's love of public lands and access to parks and monuments. I believe there are many reasons why Bears Ears National Monument and Escalante National Monument should remain preserved as much as possible. I think that these designated lands are absolutely appropriately labeled as historic monuments and places of scientific and historic importance. Bears Ears in particular is a landmark success as a place managed jointly by native organizations as well as governmental organizations. When considering how to manage ancient archeological sites such as the several found in Bears Ears, I find it really disrespectful to not recognize the history that real people have in them. Not only have native historical artifacts but also Native American culture has been essentially destroyed since the West was colonized as part of the US, and preserving Bears Ears and similar places seems like a minimal repayment of a tiny bit of respect in return. Biodiversity is one thing that may save humanity in our quest to remain healthy into the future while we and these monuments protect habitat for several threatened species such as the Mexican spotted owl, an important apex predator. Biologically diverse ecosystems are more resilient and have a higher chance of success during environmental changes like the current ones we are experiencing. Finally, I believe that tourism and sustainably managed industry can be much more beneficial to the local populations of these areas, take the town of Forks, WA after regulation for the spotted owl hurt the timber industry there; the wilderness outfitter and camping industries soared, and those communities are thriving economically while conserving resources rather than short term, unsustainable extraction.Thanks again.",Yes,Positive,https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=DOI-2017-0002-78403

Monument status for Bears Ears protects 100,000 archaeological and cultural sites as well as stunning mesas, canyons and arches and the incredible outdoor recreation, hunting, fishing and general solitude and peace they contain -- these treasures are irreplaceable. The designation and boundaries of the monument honors the voices of five sovereign tribal nations who joined together to seek protection of their shared ancestral lands and traditions, Bears Ears National Monument should remain protected permanently.Additionally, a threat to one monument is a threat to them all. Sending a signal that protections for our shared history and culture are not permanent would set a terrible precedent. This would discourage business investment and community growth around all national monuments while also sending the signal that our history and natural wonders are negotiable.

DOI-2017-0002-30354,"Dear Secretary Ryan Zinke,Dear Secretary Ryan Zinke / Department of the Interior,I have visited several National Monuments over the years, including those up for review. I have seen the beauty of the original Grand Canyon National Monument, one of the earliest Monuments setup under the Antiquities Act, through my own eyes. My son was born four days ago, and my wife and I hope to visit National Parks and National Monuments in every state over his life. My father took me to several National Monuments as a child, and I turn hope to share a similar experience with newborn son when he grows older. The Antiquities Act was signed into law by Teddy Roosevelt in 1906 amid broad opposition by many in the public. At that time, many wanted to be able to build, develop, and use the resources of the land or buildings around them for personal benefit, including the majority of people at the local level. However, these lands and buildings had natural, historic, and cultural value as the Act was designed, and many of these National Monuments later became National Parks. Looking back over these last 100 years, the lands and buildings that the Antiquities Act has protected have been visited by millions over multiple generations. This in turn has helped fuel local economies. The decision to proclaim these lands and buildings by the President and to save these lands was not easy at the time as it is not today. It takes strong leadership and character to understand the broader purpose that these historic lands and buildings serve for the common people versus for using these lands and buildings only for a select few. The U.S. Supreme Court, one of the three branches of government dedicated to balancing power in the United States, has continually upheld rulings allowing designations under the Antiquities Act. I urge you to use the same level of leadership in your decision and protect all of these irreplaceable National Monuments by keeping these lands and buildings protected at the federal level.Please feel free to contact me to discuss further.

DOI-2017-0002-24432,"I respectfully submit these comments as a member of the Society for American Archaeology in support of the __________________ National Monument. The Antiquities Act itself is the result of advocacy by the public and archaeologists concerned about the preservation of the cultural heritage contained in our federal lands. It is for the continued protection of cultural resources--specifically those located within the ____________ Monument--that I am writing. The ________________ Monument, which is subject to the review procedure outlined in the Executive Order (E.O.) signed by President Trump on April 26th, contains many known archaeological sites. There are likely even more as-yet unknown sites as portions of the land have never been surveyed to locate archaeological resources. In addition to playing active roles in the cultural lives of many people today, the historic and scientific value of these places and the objects they contain cannot be overstated. They are physical ties to the past, and hold irreplaceable information about the peoples who came before us, how they lived, and how they adapted--or not--to the ever-changing natural and social environments surrounding them. If these sites are looted or destroyed, those connections, and that data, are lost forever.Some are questioning the size of recent monument designations, given that the Antiquities Act states that monument boundaries should be limited to the smallest area compatible with effective management of the assets to be protected. As far as cultural resource protection is concerned, it is important to note that the science of archaeology has evolved greatly since the time the Act was signed. We've come to recognize that archaeological sites are best interpreted as part of the landscapes that surround them. It is only from this perspective that we can gain the clearest understanding of the lives of our forebears. I understand that preserving every acre of federal land from development is clearly neither possible nor even desirable. Setting aside lands containing the most sensitive cultural values, however, is vital to the continued growth of our knowledge of the past, without which the nation's future will be greatly diminished. It is possible to achieve both outcomes. Designation of land as a monument does not have to completely preclude economic development within its boundaries. Some activities compatible with resource preservation could take place, while still giving archaeological sites a higher level of protection than is afforded on lands outside monuments. I urge you to keep these realities in mind as the Department's review of ____________National Monument continues.",No,Positive,https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=DOI-2017-0002-24432

DOI-2017-0002-15335,"I have a new National Monument in my back yard as well. Despite several years of outreachand publicity, there are still local people who are opposed to the monument and some saythey were not heard. This is always going to be the case. Many of their complaints are legitimateand need to be addressed, and could be, if the BLM, County Sheriff and Highway Patrol in mystate were properly funded, because it's clear that local people are pitching in to do what theycan. There are, of course, some locals and non-locals who don't give a xxx about anything exceptwhat they want to do right now. No respect and no manners. These people are always going tobe with us. So what can you do? The problem existed before the monument and even if youtake the monument status away. or shrink the monument, nothing has been done to address the problem, and vandalism, pothunting, looting and poaching will continue. I'm certain locals in other areas around monuments face the same problems and have the samecomplaints. They could coexist with a monument if it was taken care of, and they had some involvement.Of course, there are some people who are so busy with their own lives they don't participate. I don't blame the locals and I know how hardworking agency employees are. I've seen it from the inside andoutside. They have a thankless job like teachers. There will always be those who don't want the government in their backyard. Where are you going to live where you don't have to follow rules? To Congress and the Senate: stop cutting park and monument budgets thinking thatwill make it all go away. If you want to fight big government, take on the large agricultural and military-industrial complex. There's your money. People want their public lands properly caredfor and maintained. They want their visits to be safe from crime. They want to hear the storyof the land, get away from the city, and see the wonders. Fund our parks and monuments. Many problems could be eliminated by adequate staffing and allowing deferred maintenance to happen, and hire rangers to patrol and interpret. That would eliminate most of the problems. Volunteer steward programs will help locals get involved with agencies and become part of the solution. I'm not sorry because someone wants to use government land on a cheap lease andmake themselves rich at the cost of my cultural or natural heritage. I see them in the same categoryas those who pollute water and the air but pay nothing to clean it up. What used to be standardoperating procedures is not to be allowed anymore. There's another consideration for these ""HUGE"" monuments is that along with the petroglyphs, trees and whatever else is being protected: rural areas are becoming full of people. Yeah, I've flown over theUS and noticed miles of no houses, but in California, that's becoming rare. Anywhere people want to live that's becoming rare. With climate change, we are learning that species are ""migrating"" uphill to find optimal conditions for life. Sounds funny that trees do that, but it's true. Larger animals need largeterritories and connections to other places in order to find food and mates. Some of what is being protected is also large, like trails historic camps and roads. Other considerations: viewsheds and soundsheds. More and more we realize that sound pollution is a problem, and it affects us as well as animals. Noise affects enjoyment of the natural world and the sense of place. Have you ever beenoutside somewhere that when everyone stops talking and walking you can hear nothing at all? Why must we shortchange our future? Why is this action even being taken except that there's someoneout there that wants to make some money?

DOI-2017-0002-35360,"Dear Secretary Ryan Zinke,I have made my living as a guide on public lands, as a teacher, I brought students to public lands and watched the transformation of these students into care-takers of our public lands. I have travelled to Utah since 1988, visiting and spending money in Utah because of GSENM, what today is Bears Ears N.M. I have traveled and spent money in Nevada because of Gold Butte N.M. I now live in Montana and spend my leisure time hiking on our public lands. Gardiner, MT, my home town, survives on the economic boost because of Yellowstone NP, but also because of the public lands surrounding us. I am concerned about all public lands, but especially the ones that you are threatening the most. These lands are our legacy. Giving away OUR lands will be short term profit for a few already wealthy individuals. Giving away our lands will enable a few cronies get rich but in 25 years, the communities in the area will be dying and withering away because jobs will end, the boom will bust. However, consistent tourism is good for the economy. I speak money because that is what you seem to understand, Mr. Zinke. There are many more reasons to maintain our present national monuments: future discoveries that could save lives in the medical industry, our legacy to our descendants, our need as humans for beauty and space, who we are as a nation. No other nation on earth has the beautiful public lands that we do... please do not destroy those lands and do not destroy our legacy--this is who we are as a country.

DOI-2017-0002-5733,"Public lands should remain that way. The review of the national monuments should find that no adjustments or changes are needed but to expand our public lands where appropriate, not shrink them. My husband and I have traveled to many of these places and urge you to go in person to each location before making a decision, to see what is being sacrificed. At a minimum, surely this is the due diligence required of the job. I realize that protecting these places is not always in the short term interest of certain people, but it is these places which will make our country great in the future as well. They serve as important tourist attractions for local populations and provide a place where families can spend quality time together. If you begin removing protections here, where does it stop? These lands require federal protection because they should belong to all Americans, not just the Americans who happen to live in that state of the union. As a Tennessean, it brings me great joy that people from all over the world can see and enjoy the Smokey Mountains. At one time, they may have all been clear cut and mined to hell, and there would be no Gatlinburg, no Asheville, none of the thriving tourist economies that now benefit from that public land.

DOI-2017-0002-36481,"Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument should be permanently maintained in its entirety as a National Monument due to its significant scientific, historical, cultural, ecological, and economic value to local Native American tribes, the local region, the state of Utah, and the United States. Executive order #13792 directs Secretary Zinke to review Monuments in part based on ""concerns of State, tribal, and local governments affected by a designation, including the economic development and fiscal condition of affected States, tribes, and localities."" Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument has not only the support of local Native tribes and conservation groups, but local business groups and the majority of Utahns as a whole. The Escalante Chamber of Commerce VP wrote an editorial recently (https://morningconsult.com/opinions/americas-national-monuments-contribute-economy-support-small-businesses/) ""speak[ing] from firsthand experience about the positive impact national monuments have on our economy"". Studies from Headwaters Economics corroborate his account (https://headwaterseconomics.org/dataviz/national-monuments/). Support for the National Monument is not limited to the immediately surrounding communities. In a 2016 Pew poll (http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/assets/2016/08/3935-pew-utah-grand-staircaseescalante-topline-final.pdf), 98% of Utahns said protecting and conserving land for future generations was important to them. A majority said that designation of Grand Staircase-Escalante as a National Monument was a good thing for Utah in general, and even more so for Utah's tourism industry, its wildlife, and its environment. Almost 90% of Utahns indicated that they had used national public lands within the last year. The state of Utah notes that ""The Grand Staircase-Escalante hiking scene is world class. It's fair to say the Escalante Canyons are the premier hiking destination in the region"" (https://www.visitutah.com/places-to-go/most-visited-parks/grand-staircase-escalante/must-do). Utah also receives significant economic benefit from the 600,000 and 700,000 visitors the National Monument receives per year, who contributing $8.2 billion in tourism income and 142,500 jobs to the state as Utah tourism grows at record levels (http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865679687/Report-Utah-tourism-growing-at-record-levels.html). It is notable that there are few if any downsides to the protection of the National Monument - for example, despite outcry by a minimal but vocal minority, the Utah Bureau of Land Management estimates that grazing on Monument land has seen ""no clear trend in actual use levels and no evidence of ""sharp"" or ""precipitous"" declines in grazing on the Monument since designation"" (https://eplanning.blm.gov/epl-front-office/projects/lup/69026/89840/107421/GSENM_GRAZING_EIS_FACT_SHEET_7-28-2015_(2).pdf). A coal company holding local leases was compensated fairly at the time of the monument's establishment. The rights of all affected parties have been properly considered for over two decades. Most stakeholders support continued protection of the National Monument.Secretary Zinke is also directed to consider ""whether designated lands are appropriately classified under the Act as ""historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, or other objects of historic or scientific interest."""" Since the designation of the National Monument, approximately 20 new species of dinosaur have been discovered there (http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865601095/Dinosaur-discoveries-in-Utahs-amazing-place-get-national-attention.html). Over 300 different dinosaur species have been unearthed within Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. Such incredible archeologic richness is of obvious scientific and historical value, and deserves protection. The National Monument also provides valuable archeologic data about the Fremont and Anasazi indigenous peoples, who interacted with one another in the area and left a record of numerous prehistoric artifacts.While Secretary Zinke is instructed to consider ""that reservations of land not exceed the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management,"" the archeologic, historic, and scientific value of this land demands its preservation in totality, as we cannot be sure exactly where the next priceless discovery might be found in the area. It is further noteworthy that the legality of the National Monument has already been upheld in federal court.Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument is a national treasure, a beloved tourism destination, a stunningly beautiful landscape, and an archeological paradise. It would be foolish to reduce its protections in an attempt to trade fossils for fossil fuels. I wholeheartedly support the continued preservation of Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument and ask that the Trump administration consider its elevation to National Park status in recognition of its immense value to the American public.",No,Positive,https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=DOI-2017-0002-36481
