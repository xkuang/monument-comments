SUWA?,"Our national monuments and public lands and waters help define who we are as a nation by telling the story of our historical, cultural, and natural heritage. I am extremely disappointed that President Trump has signed an executive order that attempts to undermine our national monuments. Attempts to roll back protections for national monuments would be both illegal and terribly misguided. I strongly urge you to oppose any efforts to eliminate or shrink our national monuments.Grand Canyon-Parashant, Ironwood Forest, Vermilion Cliffs and Sonoran Desert national monuments in Arizona are truly some of the treasures of our state. The unique geology and undisturbed starry skies of Grand Canyon-Parashant, the incredible scenery of Vermilion Cliffs, the unique ecosystem and species of the Ironwood Forest and the saguaro cactus forests of the Sonoran Desert National Monument are all unrivaled and deserve the highest protections. Not only are these monuments incredibly worthy, they bring enormous benefits to our state by providing opportunities for recreation and driving the outdoor recreation economy.Bears Ears National Monument in Utah, which is first on the list for this _review,_ is a textbook example of the priceless historic, cultural and natural wonders that are protected as national monuments. Protecting 100,000 archaeological and cultural sites the monument honors the voices of five tribes who joined together to seek protection of their shared ancestral lands and traditions, Bears Ears National Monument should remain protected permanently.Additionally, an attempt to attack one monument by rolling back protections would be an attack on them all. Sending a signal that protections for our shared history, culture, and natural treasures are not permanent would set a terrible precedent. This would discourage business investment and community growth around all national monuments while also sending the signal that our history and natural wonders are negotiable. National monuments have already been shown to be tremendous drivers of the $887 billion outdoor recreation economy and businesses in gateway communities rely on the permanency of these protections when making decisions about investing in these communities. Whether at Grand Canyon-Parashant or Vermilion Cliffs in Arizona, or other monuments across the country, our national monuments should remain protected for future generations to enjoy _ they are a gift that belongs to all Americans.I am firmly opposed to any effort to revoke or diminish protections for national monuments and I urge you to support our public lands and waters and recommend that our current national monuments remain protected.","Our national monuments and public lands and waters help define who we are as a nation by telling the story of our historical, cultural, and natural heritage.",Positive
unknown,"""Dear Department of Interior,Dear Secretary Zinke,I am writing to urge you to protect each of the 27 national monuments that Donald Trump has ordered the Department of Interior to review. These historic sites represent a crucial part of our American heritage - they protect Native American sacred ground, preserve areas of historic and scientific value, and drive local economies with opportunities for recreation and tourism.An attack on any monument is an attack on the very promise of permanent and complete protection. The authority given by the Antiquities Act is well-tested and clear, and the process by which each of these 27 monuments was designated included significant local input in conjunction with a broad view of our shared national interests.You have called yourself an ""unapologetic admirer of Teddy Roosevelt"" and styled yourself in his image, but actions speak louder than preening. President Roosevelt signed the Antiquities Act in 1906 to protect our shared American landscape from corporate looting. You, in following Trump's order, are doing the opposite.I urge you to protect and preserve our nation's national monuments from Trump's overreaching attempts to sell off America's most precious resources to his campaign donors in the oil industry.","These historic sites represent a crucial part of our American heritage - they protect Native American sacred ground, preserve areas of historic and scientific value, and drive local economies with opportunities for recreation and tourism.",Positive
Unknown,"""Dear Ryan Zinke,Our national monuments and public lands and waters help define who we are as a nation by telling the story of our shared historical, cultural, and natural heritage. I am concerned that the recent Executive Order attempts to undermine our national monuments and to roll back protections of these public lands. Protected public lands are an important part of what makes America great. I strongly urge you to oppose any efforts to eliminate or shrink our national monuments.Since President Theodore Roosevelt signed the Antiquities Act into law in 1906, 16 Presidents - 8 Republicans and 8 Democrats - have used the authority granted by the act to safeguard public lands, oceans, and historic sites in order to share America's story with future generations. These national monument designations are broadly supported from coast to coast and provide a myriad of benefits to local communities, including economic boosts from tourism, places to enjoy the outdoors, clean air and water, protection for ecologically sensitive areas, and windows into our country's history.Sending a signal that protections for our shared history, culture, and natural treasures are temporary would set a terrible precedent. National monuments have been shown to be tremendous drivers of the $887 billion outdoor recreation economy and businesses rely on the permanency of these protections when making decisions about investing in these communities.From Maine's magnificent Katahdin Woods to the colorful canyons of Utah's Grand Staircase-Escalante to the western history held in New Mexico's Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks, these landmarks, landscapes, and seascapes have value which far exceeds their physical features; they manifest the core democratic ideals of freedom, justice, and equality. They are our legacy to our children and our children's children, and a gift that belongs to all Americans.I am firmly opposed to any effort to revoke or diminish protections for our national monuments. I urge you to support our public lands and waters and recommend that our current national monuments remain as they are today.Sincerely,Catherine MarxSeabrook, TX 77586""",Protected public lands are an important part of what makes America great.

IMBA?,"""Dear Secretary Ryan Zinke,As a mountain biker and a citizen co-owner of our country's public lands, I SUPPORT our existing national monuments. I SUPPORT high-quality recreation that's managed in lands protected from reckless development and irresponsible resource extraction.I OPPOSE the repeal of any national monument protections. This sets a bad precedent. These landscapes host high quality recreation on some of our country's most valuable landscapes. National monuments have proven to be popular attractions for tourists and locals alike, substantially contributing to local and regional economies.The San Gabriel Mountains, Fort Ord, and Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monuments in California are three critical landscapes that mountain bikers had ample voice in creating through a public process. Mountain bikers have trail plans under consideration in other national monuments including Browns Canyon in Colorado, Katahdin Woods and Waters in Maine and Cascade Siskiyou in Oregon. Likewise, cyclists enjoy riding the rural roads in Escalante Grand Staircase of Utah and Canyon of the Ancients Monuments in Colorado.These opportunities to enjoy our public lands have ALL come from being involved in a public process. Mountain bikers across the nation can visit and aspire to ride these trails in a natural protected environment.We applaud a public comment period but urge that a public process be incorporated for designating new monuments not used to roll back existing designations.Sincerely,Jeff BlackBoulder, CO 80304""","As a mountain biker and a citizen co-owner of our country's public lands, I SUPPORT our existing national monuments.

,"I am opposed to any alterations to Mojave Trails or Sand to Snow National Monuments.Our national monuments and public lands and waters help define who we are as a nation by telling the story of our historic, cultural and natural heritage. In light of your department's review period, I strongly urge you to maintain the size of and protections for all of our national monuments as they were originally designated, including Mojave Trails and Sand to Snow National Monuments in California.For nearly 20 years, supporters across the California desert and beyond have urged for the protection of areas of cultural and historic significance, critical wildlife corridors and lands rich in recreational values. This support ultimately led to the designation of Castle Mountains, Mojave Trails and Sand to Snow National Monuments.The monuments connect lands between Death Valley and Joshua Tree National Parks and Mojave National Preserve and form the second-largest desert preserve in the world, home to Native American spiritual and archaeological sites, Historic Route 66, pioneer trails, iconic desert wildlife corridors and unusual geologic formations.An attack on one of America's national monuments is an attack on all of them. I am opposed to any attempts to rescind or alter the size of Mojave Trials, Sand to Snow or any one of our country's national monuments.Thank you for considering my views.","I strongly urge you to maintain the size of and protections for all of our national monuments as they were originally designated, including Mojave Trails and Sand to Snow National Monuments in California",Positive
,"""I respectfully submit these comments as a member of the Society for American Archaeology in support of the Bears Ears National Monument.The Antiquities Act itself is the result of advocacy by the public and archaeologists concerned about the preservation of the cultural heritage contained in our federal lands. It is for the continued protection of cultural resources--specifically those located within the Bears Ears Monument--that I am writing.The Bears Ears Monument, which is subject to the review procedure outlined in the Executive Order (E.O.) signed by President Trump on April 26th, contains many known archaeological sites. There are likely even more as-yet unknown sites as portions of the land have never been surveyed to locate archaeological resources. In addition to playing active roles in the cultural lives of many people today, the historic and scientific value of these places and the objects they contain cannot be overstated. They are physical ties to the past, and hold irreplaceable information about the peoples who came before us, how they lived, and how they adapted--or not--to the ever-changing natural and social environments surrounding them. If these sites are looted or destroyed, those connections, and that data, are lost forever.Some are questioning the size of recent monument designations, given that the Antiquities Act states that monument boundaries should be limited to the smallest area compatible with effective management of the assets to be protected. As far as cultural resource protection is concerned, it is important to note that the science of archaeology has evolved greatly since the time the Act was signed. We've come to recognize that archaeological sites are best interpreted as part of the landscapes that surround them. It is only from this perspective that we can gain the clearest understanding of the lives of our forebears.I understand that preserving every acre of federal land from development is clearly neither possible nor even desirable. Setting aside lands containing the most sensitive cultural values, however, is vital to the continued growth of our knowledge of the past, without which the nation's future will be greatly diminished. It is possible to achieve both outcomes. Designation of land as a monument does not have to completely preclude economic development within its boundaries. Some activities compatible with resource preservation could take place, while still giving archaeological sites a higher level of protection than is afforded on lands outside monuments.I urge you to keep these realities in mind as the Department's review of Bears Ears National Monument continues.""",I respectfully submit these comments as a member of the Society for American Archaeology in support of the Bears Ears National Monument.,Positive
,"""I strongly urge you to continue to protect all national monuments that are under review, and to reject any changes to these important pieces of our nation's natural heritage.Monument designations have been instrumental in the conservation of important places and sensitive habitats for more than one hundred years. Endangered and threatened species such as desert tortoises, kit foxes, burrowing owls, pallid sturgeon, and rare native plants rely on these protected spaces. Shrinking or eliminating these existing protections would jeopardize these species and threaten their recovery.National monuments are economically beneficial to neighboring communities as many are home to outdoor recreation opportunities.Additionally, removing monument designations issued by a prior administration has never occurred. Presidents of both parties have issued monument declarations and consistently respected those issued by their predecessors.Please reject any changes to our national monuments.""","Endangered and threatened species such as desert tortoises, kit foxes, burrowing owls, pallid sturgeon, and rare native plants rely on these protected spaces.",Positive
