Without quality places to ride on our public lands, these contributions are at serious risk.Some of the monuments that are subject to the Department's review provide bike riding opportunities.

The immense historical, biological, scenic, and recreational value of our monuments cannot be re-created elsewhere but must be protected in situ. There's no ""Disneyland"" fix for this at a later date. As we learn about more about the requirements of intact ecosystems, it is clear that size is crucial. Without sufficient acreage, whether on land or in the ocean, biological diversity becomes too restricted to thrive. Without protection of entire watersheds, everything downstream is imperiled. A few years of carelessness and an area can be spoiled for generations.Our shared heritage must not be squandered to line the pockets of a few individuals, particularly not for the sake of exploitative activities that irrevocably damage that heritage. Raiding the property of ALL U.S. citizens for the economic benefit of a few would befit a self-dealing oligarchy, policy not worthy of our country.Extractive industry is self-limiting, as well as permanently destructive. Once resources have been removed, the place where they originated is left scarred, often in multiple and persistent ways.If we were in a fight for our very survival, we might entertain the idea of ""raiding"" our monuments for resources, but we're far from that situation. Coal is losing importance in power generation, timber harvest from public lands (not just National Monuments) amounts to much less than 5% of the total, and an even smaller percentage of our meat production results from grazing on public lands.

I also believe presidents should solicit input from the public before making such designations, even though the law does not require it.I oppose sweeping monument designations by administrations that fail to consider input from all stakeholders. Such designations can restrict or eliminate opportunities for responsible off-highway motorized recreation on public lands and negatively affect the economies of the communities surrounding the monuments.The Antiquities Act grants the president authority to designate national monuments to protect ""historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures and other objects of historic or scientific interest"" that are on federal lands. The law limits the size of the designations to ""the smallest area compatible with proper care and management of the objects to be protected.""Previous administrations have used the broadly defined stipulations of the Antiquities Act to create monument designations. Unfortunately, these broad designations have closed larger-than-necessary territories that were previously used for wholesome recreation, such as responsible motorized recreation that supports small business and local economies.The designation of National Monuments on public lands may reduce or end access for responsible motorized recreation.

The Department is playing politics with some of our nation's greatest treasures. This is completely unprecedented and violates the entire point of having a Department of Interior.As the wild places in this country shrink and the threat of climate change grows, we need these monuments more than ever. Growing up in Boston in the home of my immigrant parents, I didn't have many opportunities to experience nature, let alone the spectacular places our beautiful country has to offer. In my adult life, I discovered that I loved camping and hiking. I plan my vacations around getting to see the national parks. I have been to Sequoia, Joshua Tree, and Olympic. I even moved to downeast Maine because I fell in love with Acadia. I was delighted when Maine got the honor of having the Katahdin woods and waters national monument. We need these places so all Americans can enjoy the unique natural beauty of our country.The Katahdin woods is a truly spectacular place and the designation as a national monument preserves its beauty for generations to come. Maine's economy desperately needs the jobs that would come with the tourism in that remote region. The Department of the Interior has a sacred responsibility to protect our country's most precious sites. The Katahdin woods - and all the other magnificent places under review- deserve the most protection our government can give, and that is the status of national monument. State and local parks and protected areas, Bureau of Land Management, and Forest Service designations provide insufficient protection to these places. Do not revoke the national monument status from these beautiful places. Our children and grandchildren need them.",https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=DOI-2017-0002-10044,,Positive,DOI-2017-0002-49380,1k1-8wh7-857m,5/19/17,24:45.2,FALSE,"As a resident of Southwest Colorado, I am writing regarding the two monuments I am familiar with: Canyons of the Ancients and Bears Ears. 1st let me address Canyons of the Ancients, which has been a Monument since 2000, and now 17 years later is very popular in the region. Of the hundreds of people I know that live in my region, I'm aware of none than want the monument rescinded. Selfishly, I would like it to remain a monument because I regularly use it for outdoor recreation. Unselfishly, the monument is popular locally due to the economic benefit it brings to the region through tourism (http://www.denverpost.com/2017/04/26/canyons-of-the-ancients-colorado-trump-monument-review/). If the area was pockmarked with oil/gas development as is neighboring northwest New Mexico, it would no longer be a tourist attraction.Despite the decline of natural gas production in our region (associated with lower natural gas prices), the economy of SW Colorado has remained strong, and the reason is tourism has made our economy more resilient. Conversely, the communities of NW New Mexico have been devastated by the recent declines in oil/gas production. Why? Because they do not have tourism as part of their overall economic portfolio. The reason there is no significant tourism in NW New Mexico is not because it is not scenic...it is b/c all the scenic locations on federal lands have been developed for oil and gas. There are hundreds of natural arches, steep canyons, Navajo Pueblito ruins, and ancient petroglyphs throughout NW New Mexico; however, all are in areas developed for oil and gas. Tourists simply do not want to see a ruin or natural arch from a well pad. Without Monument designation, oil/gas drilling is actively encouraged on federal lands. If Monument status is revoked, the Canyons of the Ancients will become like NW New Mexico, and our local economy will suffer.This brings me to Bears Ears. There has been much misinformation regarding Bears Ears. 1st is that it consists of a ""federal land grab"", which is not the case since all land is already federally owned and all existing uses such as grazing and active oil/gas development can continue. 2nd is that it was designated ""last minute"", when in reality the tribes that are now part of the Bears Ears Coalition has been working for site protection since 2013, only when the Utah delegation quit working with the tribes did they seek Monument status. 3rd is the idea that the Monument has no local support. There are 30 designated tribes that are the original inhabitants of this landscape that support the monument designation. Also, the Monument is very popular to residents of the area that live across the Utah State line in Colorado. Additionally, I would like to point out that one reason the monument is opposed by locals in Blanding is there are a number of people there that have been continuously looting and illegally profiting from these lands for generations (http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106091937). These people know that the Monument status makes looting more difficult, challenging their illegitimate income sources. The looting indicates the cultural sites withing Bears Ears are under a real threat. Also, the Grand Canyon did not have local support initially either. If Teddy Roosevelt had not designated it is a National Monument, it would not be a publicly accessible place. The reality is over time, all these protected places eventually gain local support, and there is no reason to believe Bears Ears will be different.",https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=DOI-2017-0002-49380,,Positive,DOI-2017-0002-2980,1k1-8wck-rx1s,5/12/17,27:14.8,FALSE,"As a taxpaying, voting American citizen I urge you to protect our National Monuments.

Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument holds great value to the Bay Area region, the state of California, and the United States. Prior to its 2015 establishment as a National Monument by President Obama, Berryessa was under consideration by Congress as a National Conservation Area. Local Congressmen Mike Thompson and John Garamendi led this effort and championed the National Monument designation of Berryessa Snow Mountain, with the support of the California State Legislature, the Elem Indian Colony of Pomo Indians, local political leaders from Lake County, Yolo, and Solano, local conservationists, recreation enthusiasts, business owners, and landowners. Congressman Garamendi recently penned a public letter in support of Berryessa's continued protection in the Record-Bee (http://www.record-bee.com/article/NQ/20170504/LOCAL1/170509901). Rarely do so many diverse stakeholders express such unified support for protection of important lands. Consequently, in response to President Trump's executive order, the local area has expressed its readiness for a political and legal fight to protect the National Monument. Clearly, the ""concerns of State, tribal, and local governments affected by [the] designation"" are aligned in favor of the permanent protection of Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument.As a large, beautiful, protected area within easy driving distance of the Bay Area metro region, Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument will draw visitors year-round to the area, creating jobs and growing the local economy. In fact, many businesses in the local area are driven by tourism supported by the protection of these lands. Over half of CA residents participate in outdoor recreation, and preservation of areas like Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument provides important support for CA's $6 billion outdoor recreation economy. Notably, no private lands were impinged by the National Monument designation, nor were water rights, ranchers' grazing rights, motorized recreation, hunting, or fishing. The National Monument protects Lake Berryessa, which provides both water and hydro-powered electricity to the North Bay area. Short-sighted resource exploitation would endanger all of this, and would not be in the economic best interest of the region, CA, or the US.Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument is also an ecologically important location that demands protection in its entirety. Snow Mountain in particular is an ecologic hotspot, with one of the highest densities of biodiversity in the state. The region is home to California's second largest population of wintering bald eagles, as well as the nearly-extinct Pacific Fisher, golden eagles, northern spotted owls, martens, black bears, mountain lions, river otters, black-tailed deer, tule elk, chinook salmon, and steelhead, among other notable ecological highlights such as a variety of rare plants. These lands are especially in need of permanent preservation to ensure a block of contiguous, intact habitat for at-risk species.Executive Order #13792 further instructs Secretary Zinke to consider ""whether designated lands are appropriately classified under the act as ""historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, [or] other objects of historic and scientific interest."" Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument has been home to a long history of native peoples, including the Yuki, Nomlaki, Patwin, Pomo, Huchnom, Wappo, Laki Miwok, and Wintum indigenous peoples. The significance of this legacy is evident in the cultural sites that cover the National Monument, from seasonal hunting and gathering camps to ancient villages, quarries, tool artifacts, petroglyphs, and trade routes of ancient indigenous peoples.

Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument holds great value to the Bay Area region, the state of California, and the United States. Prior to its 2015 establishment as a National Monument by President Obama, Berryessa was under consideration by Congress as a National Conservation Area. Local Congressmen Mike Thompson and John Garamendi led this effort and championed the National Monument designation of Berryessa Snow Mountain, with the support of the California State Legislature, the Elem Indian Colony of Pomo Indians, local political leaders from Lake County, Yolo, and Solano, local conservationists, recreation enthusiasts, business owners, and landowners. Congressman Garamendi recently penned a public letter in support of Berryessa's continued protection in the Record-Bee (http://www.record-bee.com/article/NQ/20170504/LOCAL1/170509901). Rarely do so many diverse stakeholders express such unified support for protection of important lands. Consequently, in response to President Trump's executive order, the local area has expressed its readiness for a political and legal fight to protect the National Monument. Clearly, the ""concerns of State, tribal, and local governments affected by [the] designation"" are aligned in favor of the permanent protection of Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument.As a large, beautiful, protected area within easy driving distance of the Bay Area metro region, Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument will draw visitors year-round to the area, creating jobs and growing the local economy. In fact, many businesses in the local area are driven by tourism supported by the protection of these lands. Over half of CA residents participate in outdoor recreation, and preservation of areas like Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument provides important support for CA's $6 billion outdoor recreation economy. Notably, no private lands were impinged by the National Monument designation, nor were water rights, ranchers' grazing rights, motorized recreation, hunting, or fishing. The National Monument protects Lake Berryessa, which provides both water and hydro-powered electricity to the North Bay area. Short-sighted resource exploitation would endanger all of this, and would not be in the economic best interest of the region, CA, or the US.Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument is also an ecologically important location that demands protection in its entirety. Snow Mountain in particular is an ecologic hotspot, with one of the highest densities of biodiversity in the state. The region is home to California's second largest population of wintering bald eagles, as well as the nearly-extinct Pacific Fisher, golden eagles, northern spotted owls, martens, black bears, mountain lions, river otters, black-tailed deer, tule elk, chinook salmon, and steelhead, among other notable ecological highlights such as a variety of rare plants. These lands are especially in need of permanent preservation to ensure a block of contiguous, intact habitat for at-risk species.Executive Order #13792 further instructs Secretary Zinke to consider ""whether designated lands are appropriately classified under the act as ""historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, [or] other objects of historic and scientific interest."" Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument has been home to a long history of native peoples, including the Yuki, Nomlaki, Patwin, Pomo, Huchnom, Wappo, Laki Miwok, and Wintum indigenous peoples. The significance of this legacy is evident in the cultural sites that cover the National Monument, from seasonal hunting and gathering camps to ancient villages, quarries, tool artifacts, petroglyphs, and trade routes of ancient indigenous peoples. More recent remains of homesteading dating to the 1840s gold rush, milling, and railroad logging are additional important historic artifacts.

This letter is regarding that order.Much has been written about the ""Western ethos."" This intangible set of characteristics enabled the pioneers to settle and explore the lands west of the Mississippi. Today that same tenacity and those values live on in Westerners who eek out a living in our arid Western landscape. Perhaps more than any of the other values, vision is the one I think is the most uniquely Western. Today, just as 150 years ago, we have a vision of what the West should be; our collective actions have been an (often unsuccessful) attempt to make the landscape to conform with our vision.In the Antiquities Act, Theodore Roosevelt also had a vision for the West. The national monuments he and the presidents who have followed him have left behind for America are a tangible reminder of Western vision and tenacity. As Wallace Stegner said, the Western landscape-whose crown jewels are protected by our national parks and monuments-is what we as a people have built our very character against.Much of this land has inherent monetary value, as the men who have looted archaeological sites for years on Cedar Mesa, which is now protected as part of Bears Ears National Monument in southeastern Utah, would tell you. Or the men who want to drill oil and gas wells in Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument in Hawaii or mine uranium from Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument in Arizona, would tell you. However, some of it simply has been protected for the sake of protection.San Gabriel Mountains National Monument in southern California houses three federally-designated Wildernesses, and is home to last bighorn sheep herd in the Transverse Ranges. Carrizo Plain National Monument in California is the home of critically endangered species such as the giant kangaroo rat (Dipodomys ingens, a keystone species), San Joaquin antelope ground squirrel (Ammospermophilus nelsoni), and San Joaquin kit fox (Vulpes macrotis mutica). Finally, back to Bears Ears and moving beyond its monetary value, the monument symbolizes Native American sovereignty, and our government's heartfelt acknowledgement that indigenous tribal history is one of the threads that holds our nation together.In using the Antiquities Act, President Roosevelt personified the characteristic of possessing vision. He also showed incredible restraint, the rarest of virtues. The President would have remained vigilant of the landscape's monetary value to the people, but he would have reminded us sometimes we need to protect a place simply so that future generations can experience it. In this sense, he would have worked to compromise in the creation of National Monuments. Indeed, the men who followed Roosevelt saw that that was the case in Grand Staircase-Escalante, Gold Butte, Grand Canyon-Parashant, and the others. Borders of these monuments were carefully set, with the interests of all ""sides"" in mind.As a self-proclaimed disciple of Mr. Roosevelt, I'm sure you are familiar with his New Nationalism speech from 1910, in which he said, ""It is of little use for us to pay lip-loyalty to the mighty men of the past unless we sincerely endeavor to apply to the problems of the present precisely the qualities which in other crises enabled the men of that day to meet those crises."" Secretary Zinke, I am asking you to look not only at our past, but also how far we've come as a nation as you endeavor to begin this review of our National Monuments. To paraphrase John Sawhill, you have the ability to ensure that future generations judge us by what we have chosen to protect, rather than by what we have extracted from the earth.Keep our National Monuments intact.",https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=DOI-2017-0002-83598,,Positive,DOI-2017-0002-83130,1k1-8wkq-dj5x,5/25/17,33:37.8,FALSE,"Dear Mr President,I saw you and your sons being interviewed this past summer when you were still a candidate.

I was raised in California, still have family there, and together we regularly visit National Parks, National Historical Parks, and other sites of historic and scientific interest (battlefields, wildlife refuges, marine parks, etc.) in the U.S. Our trip in 2011 to Chaco Culture and Mesa Verde was a wonderful exploration of North American ancient peoples and cultures and came the spring after a trip to Egypt to experience that country's culture and people - but Chaco and Mesa Verde held their own in their own entirely special ways. Every trip to a National Park, and there have been dozens, has been greatly anticipated and we've never been disappointed. Not once.What does disappoint me, however, is learning that this administration is questioning the value of preserving the 22 parks listed in the Executive Order, in addition to Katahdin and several marine parks. I now live in New York State, where the north woods were decimated by logging and deforestation in the latter part of the 1800s. The state, in its wisdom and with a view to future generations, designated the Adirondack Park in 1902 as ""forever wild,"" which it has remained. The park contains over 6 million acres, an area that includes the mountains and surrounding lands. The surrounding lands are especially important because they provide a necessary buffer against the effects of development and industrialization. Drought conditions over the past 20 years have made it especially necessary to protect this land and the limited water that allows it to thrive. The State of New York has sued nearby states because pollution from coal generation to the west has damaged the trees, especially the fragile tree roots, and caused a haze over a once pristine environment. Many years ago I climbed Mt. Marcy - the highest point in New York and located in the Adirondacks - and it was troubling to see smog in the distance and stunted growth among the trees and bushes caused by CO2 and other pollutants. Visitors from the cities along the Eastern Seaboard hike in the Adirondacks to see pristine nature and natural beauty, wildlife and wildflowers, and not the results of urbanization they can find at home.This administration questions the value of protecting these 22 sites because conservation purposefully does not allow development, especially extraction and mining activities - all activities measured by money. The value of conservation is intangible, measured in experiences, education, and enlightenment. They are called ""national"" parks because they benefit the entire nation and all people yet to come, forever. To suggest, which this E.O. does, that there was insufficient time for comment, or to imply, which the E.O. also does, that these lands could be better managed by their respective states, does not begin to grasp the significance of these parks.

I am concerned that the recent Executive Order attempts to undermine our national monuments and to roll back protections of these public lands. Protected public lands are an important part of what makes America great. I strongly urge you to oppose any efforts to eliminate or shrink our national monuments.Since President Theodore Roosevelt signed the Antiquities Act into law in 1906, 16 Presidents - 8 Republicans and 8 Democrats - have used the authority granted by the act to safeguard public lands, oceans, and historic sites in order to share America's story with future generations. These national monument designations are broadly supported from coast to coast and provide a myriad of benefits to local communities, including economic boosts from tourism, places to enjoy the outdoors, clean air and water, protection for ecologically sensitive areas, and windows into our country's history.Sending a signal that protections for our shared history, culture, and natural treasures are temporary would set a terrible precedent. National monuments have been shown to be tremendous drivers of the $887 billion outdoor recreation economy and businesses rely on the permanency of these protections when making decisions about investing in these communities.From Maine's magnificent Katahdin Woods to the colorful canyons of Utah's Grand Staircase-Escalante to the western history held in New Mexico's Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks, these landmarks, landscapes, and seascapes have value which far exceeds their physical features; they manifest the core democratic ideals of freedom, justice, and equality. They are our legacy to our children and our children's children, and a gift that belongs to all Americans.I am firmly opposed to any effort to revoke or diminish protections for our national monuments. I urge you to support the following list of National Monuments and recommend that our current national monuments remain as they are today.AMERICAN SAMOARose AtollARIZONAGrand Canyon - ParashantIronwood ForestVermillion CliffsSonoran DesertCALIFORNIAGiant SequoiaCarrizo PlainCascade-SiskiyouSan Gabriel MountainsBerryessa Snow MountainMojave TrailsSand to SnowCOLORADOCanyons of the AncientsHAWAIIPapahnaumokukeaIDAHOCraters of the MoonMAINEKatahdin Woods & WatersMONTANAUpper Missouri River BreaksNEW ENGLANDNortheast Canyons and SeamountsNEW MEXICORio Grande del NorteOrgan Mountains-Desert PeaksNEVADABasin and RangeGold ButteOREGONCascade-SiskiyouPACIFIC OCEANMarianas TrenchPacific Remote IslandsUTAHGrand Staircase-EscalanteBears EarsWASHINGTONHanford ReachSincerely,DEBORAH SMITHOklahoma City, OK 73112",https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=DOI-2017-0002-160398,,Positive,DOI-2017-0002-48840,1k1-8wh5-zvvj,5/19/17,38:15.2,FALSE,"Dear Secretary Ryan Zinke,I am writing to ask that you maintain the integrity of America's public lands by (a) maintaining the protected status of national monuments that are currently under review, and (b) resisting efforts to open public lands to corporate interests. As Colorado residents, my family and I regularly benefit from the legacy of public lands set aside by President Theodore Roosevelt and his successors. We spend summers in the Arapahoe National Recreation Area, regularly visit Rocky Mountain National Park, and hike in surrounding areas such as the Roosevelt, Arapaho, and Medicine Bow-Routt National Forests. My two daughters (ages 12 and 7) cherish their time in the mountains, and regularly cite our visits to public lands as the happiest times in their young lives. For me, time spent in the wilderness rejuvenates my work as a faculty member at a public university, preparing the next generation of health care practitioners and studying new ways to manage debilitating diseases. Our health, well-being, and quality of life are intimately connected to our public lands.Our family knows from personal experience that when commercial interests are allowed to use these lands for logging or oil and gas development, they disfigure the area's natural beauty and sometimes make parts of it inaccessible to the public. President Roosevelt's initial designation of public lands such as national forests and national parks took place over the opposition of private companies (in that case the railroads) that wanted to use these lands for personal profit without regard for environmental consequences. Those of us who live in the West chose this area of the country in large part because of its rugged natural beauty. Colorado is among the healthiest states in the nation in large part because of the many outdoor recreation areas available. Public lands are an important resource for personal and societal renewal; Thoreau was right to say that ""in wildness is the preservation of the world.""We are extremely concerned about the current administration's prioritization of private over public interests in the use of these lands. Public lands belong to everyone, and short-term economic gains should not be allowed to trump the urgent public interest that we all have in preserving these lands for future generations.

As an outdoor enthusiast, climber, and paleontologist, I believe that America's National Parks and Monuments are the single richest resource of the U.S. Numerous stakeholders from various backgrounds enjoy these parks every single day, and the National Parks and Monuments are known all over the world for their iconic, accessible landscapes. The parks are a symbol of the government and the people working together to preserve these places of natural beauty for the public.In addition to their recreational value, many of the areas under review (especially Grand Staircase-Escalante Monument and Bears Ears Monument) contain an abundance of extremeley important fossils. It is vital that we preserve these sites and their wealth of knowledge about the past. Even within one park, different areas contain various animals from different time periods, so reducing the size of these parks would be detrimental to our discovery of the past. In addition to preserving the protected areas, I strongly support the expansion of the Red Canyon Region of Bear's Ears National Monument, which is currently unprotected. This area includes sites with the most abundant Triassic fossils anywhere.The Antiquities Act, signed by President Theodore Roosevelt, was one of the most important pieces of legislation for protecting and ensuring public access to America's greatest natural areas. Changing Monument designations without the legistlative process undermines this important Act. Furthermore, while I appreciate that you are reviewing comments from the public, the 15 day comment period is definitely not enough time to gage the public opinion on this matter. I only found out about Executive Order 13792 a week ago, and only because a friend brought it to my attention. I have talked to several people who are stakeholders on public lands and are not aware of Executive Order 13792. When I told them about it, they voiced great concern and emphasized how much they value these parks and monuments, and how important their preservation is.I think a greater amount of public outreach and longer comment period would be extremeley beneficial, allowing more input from a wide range of communities.I sincerely hope that the review of our National Monuments and Parks results in a decision in favor of protecting America's public lands for generations to come.Thank you.Sincerely,Eva HerbstSanta Rosa, CA 95404",https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=DOI-2017-0002-106246,,Positive,DOI-2017-0002-158829,1k1-8wyf-q2wy,6/15/17,40:33.3,FALSE,"Dear Secretary Ryan Zinke,I and my mother are lovers of our national parks and monuments.

They are a gift of nature to us, to this nation that was blessed with this land. They are part of who we are as Americans. We're the people who wrote the Declaration of Independence, but we're also the people who went out and inhabited - and in a way tried to conquer - this land, this gift and blessing that was bestowed upon us. The parks are part of that, they represent what was here. They represent the potentiality of what the land was like when we, as a nation, first set out.The fact that we have set these places aside and we're keeping them special means that the boundary protecting this land is this idea that it is special. I like to think that the park idea is basically the Declaration of Independence overlaid onto this land that we inhabit. In other places they set those special places aside for the very richest in their society or for people who were of the nobility. But as Americans, we rejected that, determining that this land belongs to everyone. I think that deep down, Americans realize that, that this is not just a birthright - it is a great gift and it's also a great responsibility.We pass on our nation's concept of liberty to the next generation - the same thing is true of a park. It's there for us to enjoy, but it's for everyone to enjoy for all time. These are spectacular places. You don't have to be sentimental about the Declaration of Independence, as I am, to go to a place like Glacier National Park and be awed by what you see.The creation of a park establishes that sense of a special place. When you enter a park - you think differently. You pause and it takes you a little bit out of the rush of time and I think that is why so many families take their kids back and why those kids will take their kids back because it encapsulates an imperishable moment that you experience as a child. Then you can see that experience once again through your child's experience. There are very few things that pass across generations and across time the way that does. That's what makes it so special.""Mr. Zinke, I appeal to you to visit any of our National Parks or Monuments to experience how they move your soul.If you want to broaden your knowledge and awareness of what the National Parks have meant historically, giving context to what they mean now, I encourage you to watch ""Ken Burns: The National Parks - America's Best Idea"", which you can currently watch on Amazon Prime.Thank you very much for your time and consideration!Jeff ValderNational Park enthusiast & REI MemberLincoln, NebraskaSincerely,Jeff ValderLincoln, NE 68510",https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=DOI-2017-0002-21174,,Positive,DOI-2017-0002-26901,1k1-8wfe-w0o7,5/17/17,18:49.3,FALSE,"Dear Secretary Ryan Zinke,I have such happy childhood memories of roving Craters of the Moon, the heat off the black rock.

Areas like Papahanaumokuakea, Pacific Remote Islands, Rose Atoll, Marianas Trench, and Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monuments are increasingly important in light of ongoing climate change, ocean acidification, sea level rise, and chemical and plastics pollution. Maintaining and expanding these protected areas will allow our oceans to adapt to change in the strongest way possible.While like most Americans I have never dived in any of these remote and hard to access areas, I have spent many hours snorkeling, kayaking, and whale watching in adjacent waters. I'm from New England, and protection for Northeast Canyons will help our commercial fisheries and marine mammal populations rebound. Conserving these species and the local seafood and whale watching industries, is a high priority for our regional and local New England economy. Protected areas provide additional resilience to surrounding waters and the communities that depend on these resourcesHaving worked at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, I was privileged to learn about and visit many coral reefs close to shore. While still beautiful and valuable, these inshore reefs are heavily impacted by human use, pollution, and bleaching events. Protecting more remote and resilient places like Papahanaumokuakea will help us ensure that there are sources for recolonizing corals, fish, and other organisms following coral die offs or other localized events.Rolling back protections on any one of these monuments is indeed a step backwards when it is most important that we do MORE. As an ecologist I am trained to study and respect both the resilience and fragility of our natural systems. Places like our National Parks, National Wildlife Refuges, and National Monuments are there to sustain America's cultural and scientific legacy; most of us will never get to visit the ocean National Monuments, but they are an irreplaceable treasure.President Trump is setting a dangerous precedent by trying to nullify the protection of these vital monuments. The Antiquities Act, signed by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1906, safeguards and preserves U.S. public lands and waters that contain objects of historic or scientific interest. Sixteen past presidents - eight Republicans and eight Democrats - have used this authority to designate over 150 monuments, thereby preserving our special places at sea and on land for future generations of Americans. There is strong support among members of the American public to maintain fisheries and protect crucial wildlife habitat. Our diverse U.S. marine monuments protect a rich array of ocean species and their habitats, provide nursery and spawning habitats for commercially-valuable fish and crustacean populations, and offer sought-after recreational angling opportunities. Deep-sea ecosystems in the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts are home to sperm whales, Atlantic puffins, and lush deep sea coral gardens, including one of the planet's oldest organisms, black corals, and other species that may contain chemical compounds of biomedical importance. The expansion of Papahnaumokukea prevents sharks, sea turtles, sea birds, and marine mammals from being caught by longline fishing and helps safeguard the traditional culture of the Native Hawaiian community. All of these organisms as well as the marine-based ways of life are constantly threatened by human actions. If America doesn't do its part in protecting these special places, we are failing as a country and as citizens and stewards of our planet.Please consider my voice, as a consumer, a tourist, a wildlife watcher, and a scientist. Most Americans stand behind protection of these national monuments and their counterparts on land. Please do not alter or eliminate any of the protections for the marine national monuments.Please accept this letter as an official public comment for Docket No. DOI-2017-0002.Sincerely,Kelly OmandNantucket, MA 02554",https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=DOI-2017-0002-153088,,Positive,DOI-2017-0002-39178,1k1-8wg5-r7cd,5/18/17,09:33.6,FALSE,"Dear Secretary Ryan Zinke,I'm writing to you as a small business owner to ask that you protect public lands and national monuments. My business hosts wilderness medicine courses throughout Arizona and the Southwest. My students are park rangers, guides, and outdoor enthusiasts. Like many businesses in the outdoor recreation industry, it's critical that America's system of public lands, national parks, and national monuments be preserved.I understand that you are receiving significant pressure from representatives of the oil and gas industry to 'free up' public lands for economic development. As you know, however, outdoor recreation contributes more to the American economy than extractive industries. If you're trying to make the right decision economically, then the answer is clear -- the outdoor recreation industry and it's minimal impacts will contribute more to the economy in both the short and long run.I also understand that you are receiving significant pressure from 'local interests' regarding our public lands. Flagstaff is completely surrounded by public lands, and I certainly want to be involved in the decision-making in our area -- I don't begrudge locals for wanting to have input. Ultimately, however, the land belongs to all Americans and not just the locals. While local input is important, it should not outweigh the interests of the vast majority of Americans that support the conservation of public lands.Instead, in the case of monuments, locals should be educated on the massive, positive economic impact of national monuments. For example, on the edge of the new Bears Ears National Monument, the community of Blanding has experienced stagnant economic 'growth' for decades while communities outside the well-established Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument have experienced huge economic growth. The small population of Blanding may not understand or appreciate the experience of other Utahns that have benefited from monuments. The Bears Ears region is incredible, and the local communities will benefit from the increased tourist traffic that results from its designation as a monument.America's public lands are the envy of the world. Why would you endanger these lands to decrease the economic benefit? Rescinding or reducing the size of monuments and selling off our public lands would clearly be a poor decision for the nation and would ensure that your reputation would be impugned in American history books for all time.Please preserve Bears Ears and our other national monuments in their current states and work to protect our other public lands.",https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=DOI-2017-0002-39178,,Positive,DOI-2017-0002-30183,1k1-8wfr-66vy,5/17/17,10:25.5,FALSE,"Dear Secretary Ryan Zinke,I've explored many of our national parks.

There is no good reason for a shortened calendar for Bears Ears other than to concede to the demands of elected officials in Utah who have ignored public demands for permanent public lands protection for many years. They are simply seeking to open up our special national heritage lands to private companies for private benefit, depleting resources instead of ensuring that our children and grandchildren can visit Bears Ears and other special places in the future.This unprecedented review of 27 national monuments is a significant threat to our public lands that will forever alter the ability of future Presidents to protect America's special places. There is significant pressure from Utah's politicians to undo the permanent protections afforded Bears Ears in December. I implore you to ignore that pressure and uphold the Bears Ears monument designation. Please do not authorize a reversal of the Bears Ears monument or reduce its boundaries, as doing so will put all monuments - not just the 27 under initial review - at significant risk. An attack on Bears Ears is truly an attack on all monuments.I hope that your visit to Utah demonstrated that there is tremendous local support for monument designations at Bears Ears and Grand Staircase Escalante. There is also substantial economic value generated from these monuments and many others also under review. In fact, a tourism brochure produced by the state of Utah's highlights Grand Staircase Escalante as one of Utah's most wonderful public land areas. And the American people have responded by visiting and spending their hard-earned dollars in the local area. The same is now happening in Maine as a result of the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument designation in August 2016, providing the hope of a sustained economy in a region that currently has very little to count on.I appreciate that you went to Utah and hope you will visit the other monuments under initial review. I am confident that you will be moved by the variety of protected lands now available to all Americans through these national monument designations, and that your support for public lands will be renewed and restored.In sum, I oppose the review of national monuments and urge you to resist all pressure to undo the protections of the Antiquities Act.

These are some of the most breathtakingly beautiful lands in this country - every bit as gorgeous as the much more popular national parks.This isn't being written by someone living hundreds of miles from the nearest monument under review.

These people play a major role in bringing money to local communities by staying at hotels, eating at restaurants, buying groceries, etc. These monuments are visited for their natural and cultural value. Stripping protections on these monuments to allow oil/gas exploration (or other forms of resource extraction), motorized use in sensitive areas, and increased livestock grazing all would not only be bad for the land and the environment, but it would also create eye sores that could decrease the scenic and recreational value of the land. In turn, this could harm our local communities if visitors decide not to come.I oppose any changes to the powers of the Antiquities Act, and I vehemently oppose any effort to modify, weaken, or downsize our current national monuments.As someone who has lived almost my entire life in the western United States, I honestly believe that the scenic value of our public lands cannot be overstated.

Allowing these lands to persist under the protection of national monuments is critical in our increasingly populated world, where fewer people are connecting with nature.Ultimately, I trust that the right decision will be made, and that future generations will have the same opportunities to enjoy our national monuments and their natural beauty.

Most of these lands were already managed by the Federal government as part of the National Estate, seized from the Native Americans and Mexican inhabitants by violence and coercion many years ago in the interests of westward expansion, the interests of the few who would profit, and the grasping of political power by the elites of the time.

Rescinding the Bears Ears National Monument would be unprecedented. I strongly urge you to uphold the monument's current boundaries.Bears Ears is a sacred landscape with more than 100,000 Native American cultural sites. The proposal to establish it was developed by a coalition of five sovereign Tribal Governments (Hopi, Navajo, Ute Mountain Ute, Ute, and Zuni). Bears Ears is also home to scientific wonders, irreplaceable wildlife and biodiversity, and recreational opportunities that form a vital base to the local economy. That is why Utahns and Americans across the country - sportsmen, business leaders, Native Americans, veterans, conservationists, recreationists, and members of the faith community - have agreed it should be protected for future generations.This designation received an enormous amount of scrutiny, including years of debate and discussion. Dozens of community meetings and public discussions were held throughout 2016, including a well-attended public meeting with then-Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell.

I remember gazing up at the night sky in Grand Staircase Escalante--surrounded in every direction by that vast, mystical desert--and thinking this is the place that sets my soul free.

Being in that quiet and beautiful corner of the world filled my mind with a limitless sense of possibility and excitement at the dawn of my own career in public service.

My friend has never been awake at 4:30 but watching the sun paint the desert every shade of pink, seeing birds wake up and take flight off of the saguaro, and feeling the hot breeze against our cheeks was an experience neither of us will ever forget. It's the kind of experience I hope to share one day with my children and grandchildren, and they theirs.

I fear that any rollback or reduction of these areas would open the spaces up not only to damaging resource extraction practices, but would also set a dangerous precedent for how all our public lands may be viewed and managed in the future. National monuments should be preserved in perpetuity for public enjoyment and environmental protection. They are our national treasures and I believe the federal government should continue to serve as a leader in these values and a steward of these spaces. I still haven't been to Bears Ears but I can't wait to get there at the next opportunity. I can't wait to visit all 27 of these monuments on this list and experience the unforgettable wonders each has to offer.",https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=DOI-2017-0002-110540,,Positive,DOI-2017-0002-104973,1k1-8wlh-p38m,5/26/17,48:33.8,FALSE,"Dear Secretary Zinke,I write to express my strong support for keeping Bears Ears, Grand Staircase-Escalante, Grand Canyon-Parashant, Vermillion Cliffs, Basin and Range, Craters of the Moon, and all the other national and marine monuments you are reviewing just as they are. These places were legitimately set aside by former presidents using the Antiquities Act of 1906 and they should not be undone, reduced in size, opened to new resource exploitation or other development, or allowed to have activities that were not identified when they were created. These lands belong to you, to me, and to every other American. They should not be sacrificed for the benefit of a few powerful companies and individuals whose activities would forever compromise them through development and resource extraction. Those activities are not compatible with preserving the integrity, natural beauty, scientific value, solitude, plant and wildlife habitat, archaeological sites, Native American sacred sites, clean air, natural night skies and much more of these special places. The existing national and marine monuments should be kept as they are for the enjoyment of all citizens now and in the future.I have lived on the Colorado plateau most of my adult life. I have spent time in most of the western monuments under review, some before they were even monuments. I have actually lived and worked in quite a few of these places doing research for the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, State of Utah, etc. For many of these places, I know how special and unique they are from first hand experience. I feel they DO reflect ""The requirements and original objectives of the Act, including the Act's requirement that reservations of land not exceed ""the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected"". I have spent the most time in Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante. These places have values and characteristics that are unmatched anywhere else on earth. While some of our elected officials and a small cadre of people who live in southern Utah feel the monuments are too large, one could actually argue the opposite for they preserve only the heart of the best of canyon country in southern Utah.The Grand Staircase-Escalante has not harmed the local economy or taken money from our public schools as some would have you believe. It has brought jobs and economic growth to the area. The land was federal land before the monuments and federal land now, so the monument designationwas not a land grab and did not affect school funding or take away jobs. Traditional activities, such as grazing and Native American herb collection continue as they always did. I know you didn't have time to speak with the Escalante Chamber of Commerce while you were out here, but please take the time to reach out to them now, to learn of the new jobs created by the monument and the fact that people who had to leave for jobs have now been able to come back home and find local employment due to the monument. During your visit to our amazing monuments, you also did not meet with the Native American led Utah Din Bikyah group, which is fighting for protection of Bears Ears. Please reach out to them now. They are a group of 5 Native American tribes with ties to the land. Bears Ears encompasses the ancestral homelands, including many ceremonial sites, burial areas, sacred herb gathering areas, and Traditional Cultural Properties of at least four of these tribes.According to the news reports, you spent most of your time with the governor, members of the Utah congressional delegation, and some county commissioners, all of whom oppose anything to do with monuments and the federal govt owning land in Utah. Despite being elected officials, they do not represent what the majority of Utah residents feel about the monuments. For Bears Ears, there was a long process called the PLI where some of our congressional representatives tried to push through an unacceptable alternative for Bears Ears. There were endless hearings and meetings, but the opinions and wishes of many, including the Tribes (who are sovereign nations), were not heard or respected. President Obama patiently waited for the Utah delegation to find a good solution and make compromises, but when they did not and could not, he acted. There was plenty of public input. Unfortunately, Congressman Bishop and Chaffetz did not want to hear it or act on it so Obama came up with a compromise. The Bears Ears is actually closer in size to the PLI than what the environmental groups wanted.Also, please remember, the people who live by the monuments are not the only locals. Many of us in central and northern UT visit the monuments often and they do belong to ALL Americans. Please do not sell out for short-term gain for a few, but keep the monuments as they are for the benefit of the many, and the benefit of current and future generations.

Monument status for Bears Ears protects 100,000 archaeological and cultural sites as well as stunning mesas, canyons and arches and the incredible outdoor recreation, hunting, fishing and general solitude and peace they contain -- these treasures are irreplaceable. The designation and boundaries of the monument honors the voices of five sovereign tribal nations who joined together to seek protection of their shared ancestral lands and traditions, Bears Ears National Monument should remain protected permanently.Additionally, a threat to one monument is a threat to them all.

The land was already owned by the federal government; managed by the BLM and the USFS. Furthermore, all land in the west was acquired by the federal government though treaty or purchase. This was not a land grab, the Antiquities Act was used as intended to protect a place important to western culture.Our National Monuments and public lands represent the heritage and character of the west. Us westerners love wide-open spaces and wild places. Our public lands are the buffers around our homes. Public lands spread us out and create places to roam, climb, hunt, fish, camp, bike, hike, and 4-wheel.President Trump has no understanding of life in the west or rural America. He is a New York city slicker, and now a Washington elite. He knows nothing of our way of life or how we use our lands. Do not let a city slicker like President Trump take away our public lands.Previous Presidents have used the Antiquities Act to create National Monuments, this was not interference in our way of life. This was an effort to protect our way of life from exploitation. In the case of Bears Ears the forces pushing on President Obama to issue the monument declaration were westerns.As a fellow western I except you to understand our way of life and the importance of protecting our public lands. Protection of our lands, both public and private is something we all agree on in the west.In closing do not let President Trump rescind or change any existing National Monuments status.

I remember the great uproar when President Carter created a large number of new national monument in Dec. 1978, two years later congress acted to designate most of the lands as new national parks, monuments, and wildlife refuges.

National Monument designations, under the Antiquities Act of 1906, are meant to ensure the proper care and management of historic landmarks and other objects of historic or scientific interest. The Act also states that the monuments shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with proper care and management of the objects.In recent decades, presidents from both parties have used the power of the Act to designate hundreds of thousands of acres, and in some cases millions of acres at a time. This scale of designation goes far beyond the executive authority that had Congress originally intended. Such abuse restricts or even prohibits economic opportunity and removes decision making from the states and private citizens. These designations have affected water rights, grazing rights and access to state and private lands.Use of the Antiquities Act for large tract designation does not provide reasonable notice to the public, and has gone well beyond Congress' original intent to designate the smallest portion of land needed to protect certain objects of genuine historic and scientific interest. Because there is no requirement to determine what the impact of the designation would be on communities and the local economy, these executive actions can lead, and in fact have led, to devastating reductions in economic activity and the loss of jobs in resource-dependent communities. We urge the executive branch to discontinue designation of any national monument under the Antiquities Act until the proposal is first vetted and approved by Congress, landowners and local governments affected by these decisions.Since 1906, 145 national monuments have been designated for federal protection. 105 are managed by the National Park Service, 23 by the Bureau of Land Management, 10 by the USDA Forest Service, 7 by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and 1 by NOAA Fisheries.In Oregon, the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument area must be addressed. The national monument designation of 48,000 additional acres in January 2017 will have devastating effects on the farm, ranch and timber community. The monument, spanning nearly 87,000 acres, links the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument to the Oregon Caves National Monument and the Siskiyou Wilderness Area.Declaring a Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument appeared to be a good idea to some because it seems to have a positive connotation, but it is fundamentally irresponsible, as it works directly against the best interests of the local environment, community and the very industries that support the local economies.Proponents of the monument maintain it would have no impact on private lands or landowners. Nothing could be further from the truth. The declaration of the monument has had a direct impact on the natural resource industry, which makes up much of the economy in Southern Oregon.In parts of the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument, the land is checkerboarded, meaning it is intertwined with private property. Other private property is directly adjacent to those federal lands. There is no reasonable or realistic way to expect that those landowners will be able to continue operations as they current exist. Wild areas need to be protected, but maintaining healthy forests and other natural areas over the long haul is a complex process. The taking of an area and a state that is so desperately in need of jobs and dollars it is blatantly irresponsible.Finally, as farmers and ranchers, we care deeply about the land. Not only to we live on the land, we enjoy and depend on it. At a time when we are desperately trying to revive our rural communities, this designation and future possible designations will be a huge stumbling block. If one can't provide for themselves or a family there is no hope of attracting youth back to this area.

His agendas are transparent to anyone paying attention, and as this president has virtually no relationship with, nor appreciation for, our public lands as anything other than a way to curry favor with industry and special interests, he has no interest in their natural or cultural value. None. He would be happy to sell them off, or permanently destroy them by fracking, drilling, and open pit mining, letting the taxpayer pick up the tab for any attempts at mitigation after these lands have been ruined.This is simply unacceptable on all levels. From Bears Ears to Sand to Snow, these monuments have been studied, planned, discussed, and contemplated. At a time when preservation of our natural and cultural/historical resources needs to be a priority, we simply cannot allow this rogue president to strip the work of previous presidents so he can push his own agenda.As an American, it is of vital importance to me that our federal government works to preserve these national monuments to support the natural ecosystems they protect, the wildlife dependent upon them, the historical sites and culturally significant areas contained within them. It is of utmost importance that Native American cultural, historical, and sacred sites are respected and protected, and these are not sites that can be isolated and kept out of context of their surroundings. There are numerous aspects to preservation of these lands that must be taken into consideration that the president himself either cannot grasp, or simply dismisses out of gross ignorance and blatant pandering. He simply cannot be allowed to destroy the work other presidents have done to preserve these national public treasures.To allow such reversal and destruction of these national monuments is the true definition of obscenity. As someone who lives among these lands, draws strength from their beauty and richness, has gotten to know and understand how much they have to offer, and wants to ensure my grandchildren and the grandchildren of other Americans grow up in an America where our natural and cultural treasures are not treated like commodities, raped of their monetary value and left behind as wastelands, I simply must insist that the president's agenda must be halted. Our national monuments up for ""review"" must be left intact. Our president, whose idea of experiencing nature is to play golf, must have his ignorance and lack of appreciation for real wild lands and areas of Native cultural significance, as well as historic importance, take a back seat to preserving these lands for Americans now, and into the future.These reviews must be halted, and if not by those hired by the American people to manage these lands responsibly, then through the courts and the court of public opinion. I will do all I can personally and professionally to frustrate this administration's highhanded abuse of these national monuments. This is simply, and utterly, unacceptable. It is something I must object to in every way possible, from a deep level. For once these places have been allowed to be raped and destroyed for profit, there is no getting them back. Ever. And our president would never even notice they were gone. But he will not be in office long, and it is imperative the Department of the Interior, and the American people, prevent him from wreaking havoc while he is in office.

There is no reason to change them or even review them. This entire process is a waste of taxpayer money. Countless hours went into the crafting of these monuments, there is no need for review. The current monuments are all beautiful places that need protection from mining, logging, drilling, grazing and development. They should be left in as close to their natural state as possible so that all people can enjoy them for generations to come. They must remain under the control of the federal government because they are owned and enjoyed by the entire nation, not just the people in adjacent states.The antiquities act should remain in force so that more monuments can be designated and more wild places can be protected. The only thing I would consider changing in Bears Ears National Monument, if anything should be changed at all, is to make it a national park to eliminate grazing. Grazing is an inefficient use of land and it is incredibly destructive to desert lands.I have spent countless hours walking through many of these monuments and I can attest to their beauty and the need to keep them as they are.

These monuments were created to prevent just that. These industries are destructive and focused on profit for the few. Any jobs created would be short lived in comparison to the recreation industry and jobs created by the existence of the monuments themselves. These are long term jobs as long as the monuments remain in tact and protected. Once you drill or mine or graze or frack, there is little left to enjoy.

This designation was done thoughtfully and carefully after understanding the cultural and natural history of the region including over 1000 cultural sites associated with Native America Tribes in the region which were being destroyed by the uses of the land. The designation of the area as a monument allows for oversight and protection of these historical sites. At the time of its designation, additional lands had been requested to be included by tribes and others but were ultimately excluded to find balance between the interest of protection under the antiquities act and public access.In addition to its protection of cultural and natural history, the designation as a monument ensures that the general public will have, unless this administration abuses its power and reverses the designation, access to 1.35M acres of land for recreational and access to the cultural history of the tribes of Southern Utah instead of the land being destroyed and access limited by companies with commercial or personal objectives to exploit and destroy these natural resources for short-term profit.

The size of Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument is the minimum to support these natural resources of scientific and cultural significance.As national monuments, public lands such as Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument will help to sustain our outdoor traditions for future generations of sportsmen and women. National monuments are a part of our public land heritage that deserves to be celebrated, not jeopardized.I oppose any efforts to rescind or diminish Cascade-Siskiyou or any other national monument.

This review process appears to be an attempt to strip the protections provided by National Monument status with a goal to transfer these lands to private interests for development of these lands: to mine them for minerals, possibly to construct luxury vacation accommodations accessible to only the wealthy, opening the lands for grazing that is not properly managed, or other damaging forms of land use and development.President Trump declared, ""The Antiquities Act does not give the federal government unlimited power to lock up millions of acres of land and water, and it's time that we ended this abusive practice.""In the United States, the government is the people and federal lands belong to the people -- all of the people. Lands are not ""locked up"" when they belong to everyone, and it is not an abusive practice to preserve and protect important American lands.I strongly oppose the idea that state governors and those living near National Monuments should have the ultimate say over how the land is managed. Lands that are culturally valuable, have immense scenic value, are historically meaningful, require permanent ecological protection and preservation, are important for recreational uses -- these lands must be preserved for the present and the future and, in many cases, protected and preserved for the non-human species that depend on those lands.I believe that the concept of ""limited government"" is an expression used to decrease protection of American lands and give those valuable public lands to private interests that seek to exploit those lands for private profit. Exploitation of protected lands can lead to damage and destruction of land value, and privatization takes public land and gives it to private interests, thereby locking it away from the public. Privatization can destroy recreational value. Exploitation and privatization can destroy historical, ecological, and scenic value.Our nation does not cry out for limited government in relation to its military, so why do we need limited government in other areas of concern? Cries of ""limited government"" are only heard when a private interest's goals to generate private wealth are frustrated. The concept of limited government is only expressed by those whose plans are thwarted when the people of the United States, through the powers of the federal government, preserve national resources using laws written for that very purpose.Some of the monuments under review are located in California.

In 2016 then President Obama listened to the coalition of five tribes that had come together to protect their sacred lands, and although smaller than the optimum, designated 1.3 million acres. Bears Ears names a spectacular area that also includes the remarkable Comb Ridge, Indian Creek, and White Canyon and exquisite habitat, all of which are important to the tribes because of approximately 100,000 ancient archaeological sites along with present cultural significance.World-class recreational opportunities exist for those of us who visit Utah to see and travel in this landscape of weathered sandstone, forested heights, deep canyons, and ancient cliff dwellings. Tourism is important to Utah's economy, and Bears Ears along with other Monuments, Parks, and Wilderness are the key to visitation. Since I live in the area and have traveled there as much as I am able, I am proud and relieved that greater Bears Ears has finally been afforded protection. Political policy in Utah has prevented this in the past and in no way should be allowed now to take us back to that time when Bears Ears could be looted, developed, bought and sold, and damaged from mineral exploration. These are activities that destroy ""the peoples land"" and benefit only a few of the wealthy and powerful, let alone the general public looking for jobs.The United States has not always treated our native people well, and now is a good time to acknowledge the importance of their presence, their history and culture, and their rich contributions to our society. They have formed a coalition, which has been joined by many Utah citizens and many of us in other states of various backgrounds and experience because after all, Utah's beautiful Monuments and Parks belong to all of us.You've seen this landscape, and as an outdoor person, I hope you were able to stay long enough to feel its magic and learn of its importance.Thank you for this opportunity to present my comments.Sincerely,Susan Morgan, PhDP.O.

I urge you to not to participate in the destruction of the legacy we should pass on to future generations.Of the many arguments to be made in support of the Monuments, I will just touch on two.First, Monuments are not land grabs as often cited by politicians. The lands were public before designation and remain so. The land grabs are the fantasies of those such as Representatives Chaffetz and Bishop that want to sell off OUR public lands for short term gain. The designations were carried out after extensive research and public consultation. Those that contend otherwise are liars.Second, Monuments are economic boons to the nearby communities and to the nation as a whole. Nationwide, outdoor recreation generates 887 billion dollars of consumer spending annually and creates 7.6 million jobs. In your home state of Montana, outdoor recreation generates 5.8 billion dollars of consumer spending, and provides over 64,000 jobs in a state with a population of just over a million. Don't kill the goose that laid the golden egg.In closing, I implore you to part company with your Republican brethren on this issue and actually put your country first, not your party.Sincerely,Michael MacklinPO Box 1944Las Vegas, NM 87701macklin.m@gmail.com505 426 0685Cc:Senator Tom UdallSenator Martin HeinrichRepresentative Ben Ray Lujan",https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=DOI-2017-0002-3158,,Positive,DOI-2017-0002-42010,1k1-8wgh-cuvf,5/18/17,10:37.6,FALSE,"Mr Secretary, maybe you and the President haven't noticed, but undeveloped land and marine environments everywhere on the planet are in ever-decreasing ""supply"", requiring the Dept of Interior to actively engage in preserving what's left for the benefit of citizens, visitors, local economies, and the plants and animals still extant.

Zinke,Please rescind the Bears Ears Monument. We support common sense protections to ensure ongoing enjoyment and utilization of these magnificent lands, and the wildlife herds and hunting on these 1. 3 million acres. Certainly, this is an area that has been wonderfully managed for wildlife, hunting, and other uses by the state of Utah. Those impacted the most by a national monument designation are a critical concern. State driven processes with all stakeholders collaborating are the right way to make land use determinations, not top down monument designations of massive landscapes with little local or state support.We also recognize that national parks in the state of Utah were areas first designated as monuments. What this means, is that the Bears Ears Monument designation puts this area on the pathway to permanent hunting closures. While pithy slogans and protectionist rhetoric sound well intentioned, make no mistake, most of those who are pining for ""protection"" through a national monument designation do not support our right to hunt and fish in these areas. They want these areas closed to hunting. A national monument designation takes them one step closer to their dangerous objective. Losing these world class-hunting areas would be sad outcome. It would erode the rights of sportsmen, decades of herd restoration, and the millions invested by Utah Sportsmen. As we have seen repeatedly, when hunting is banned, herds suffer and even disappear. It is not good for hunters and it is not good for wildlife. There is a better way to manage and ensure abundance of these herds and habitats for future generations.The voice of sportsmen was ignored as part of the monument designation process. This is particularly disappointed considering that for decades, Utah sportsmen have been the stewards of a massive effort to restore wildlife to these areas. We have restored natural mosaics to control wildfire, enhanced habitat for wild game and grazing, developed water resources, and reintroduced elk, mule deer, wild turkeys, and bighorn sheep. Even after all of these efforts, local sportsmen along with local and state wildlife managers were not consulted about the impacts of this Monument Designation. Unfortunately, one of the primary impacts would be on the very programs and management investment that are needed the most to protect the herds of elk, mule, big horn sheep, wild turkeys, and other wildlife we have worked so hard to restore.The results of these proactive and expensive conservation efforts have been amazing. The San Juan Elk unit is one of the top Elk Herds in the World with many 400-inch bulls and even world record elk harvested. The deer herds in this area are thriving. Two of Utah's premier Desert Bighorn Sheep hunting units also lie within the monument designation boundary. Proof of the success of these efforts is the over 50,000 applicants for hunting permits to these units every year. Not only does this show the popularity of these units, but also demonstrate how important sportsmen funding is to continue on-the-ground management and conservation in these areas.These herds only exist because of sportsmen funding, thousands of volunteer hours, predator control, and millions of dollars in on the ground habitat enhancement and water development efforts. Our experience with Grand Staircase has been disappointing. Habitat enhancement projects through pinyon/juniper management is significantly more difficult and a lot more expensive, if they are even allowed. Predator control has become very restricted and limited. As a result, the Escalante Desert Bighorn herd, once one of the top Desert Bighorn herds in the world, has dramatically declined. The area has become more susceptible to catastrophic wildfire. In essence, the preservationist mentality has been a failure for wildlife and the habitat work most needed to ensure abundant herds of wildlife.As a sportsman and Big Game Forever supporter, I strongly encourage you to rescind Bears Ears monument. It is the best way to ensure the continuation of the efforts, collaboration, and programs that are doing the most to protect, restore, and enhance the hunting, access, in this corner of the state of Utah. Our efforts have worked to make this area truly one of a kind for hunters, wildlife lovers, and all who appreciate the wild things and wild places that Utah hunters have worked so hard to restore.Please rescind the Bears Ears monument designation. We love hunting on these incredible public lands, and want them protected. However, monuments are very restrictive on land and wildlife management. Whatever the future plans are for these areas, Utah Hunters have earned a seat at the table. We encourage you to pursue solutions that will protect state management of wildlife, hunting, and the collaborative, common-sense management investment of Utah's hunters, families and hard working rural communities that has worked for generations.Sincerely,",https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=DOI-2017-0002-76759,,Negative,DOI-2017-0002-8274,1k1-8wdg-btn1,5/14/17,56:40.0,FALSE,"Secretary of the Interior ZinkeDepartment of the InteriorWashington, DCMay 13, 2017RE:Canyons of the Ancients National MonumentSecretary Zinke,I am writing concerning President Donald Trump's Executive Order #13792 of April 26, 2017 which presents the possibility that National Monuments and Parks could be reduced in size and/or put into the hands of individual states to manage. A part of the order requires public input to the Department of the Interior on the issue. This is my input on Canyons of the Ancients National Monument.National Monuments are a jewel in the crown of our pubic lands. Over the years I have visited, hiked, and camped in most of the ones being considered for public commentary. I have found them to be beautiful and inspiring places, both for their natural history and often for their human history. The importance of many of them to the rights and history of indigenous peoples is undeniable. In the case of this Monument, the desires of Indigenous Peoples in the area should not be ignored. Too many treaties have been broken so far. Many archeological resources have been lost in this area have been lost, due to the building of a dam on the Dolores River. No further loss should be allowed. In my opinion, as a Biologist, I believe the total acreage incorporated into this Monument is necessary to accomplish protection and inclusion of all necessary aspects pertaining to resources for which the Monument was established. National Monuments remain places where the visitor can enjoy the setting without the intrusion of commercial interests. These Monuments belong to all the people of the United States and I am pleased to have my Federal Taxes help to pay for them. For this reason I believe they should be kept under protection by the Federal Government and not left to the caprice and potential special interests presented by State Governments.Please enter this letter into your public commentary.Best Regards,Ann Kircher578 Moultrie StreetSan Francisco, California 94110415 305 2251annkircher@gmail.com",https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=DOI-2017-0002-8274,,Positive,DOI-2017-0002-103890,1k1-8wlg-9e0r,5/26/17,36:45.1,FALSE,"Secretary Ryan Zinke,As a citizen, a voter, and an outdoorsman, I value Bears Ears National Monument and the other public lands which are set aside for the use of all US citizens.

We not only want these monuments to remain intact & in public ownership, but also expect their current boundaries to be honored & maintained. These public lands are owned by ALL U.S. citizens, not just white Utahns who live in or near Blanding and Monticello, UT, nor are they the exclusive property of our vision-less Utah State & county (San Juan & Kane) politicians.It is not true that the Antiquities Act was inappropriately used to establish Bears Ears National Monument, or that it was a ""Midnight"" designation. The public lands comprising the monument are rife with archaeologic and scientific values, & were acknowledged in the failed Public Lands Initiative (PLI). President Obama was petitioned by his Native American constituents (a group of U.S. citizens that felt ignored during the PLI process) to use the Antiquities Act to designate the area as a national monument. Former Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell visited the area and held four days of public meetings to understand what was a stake. The President delayed monument designation for Bears Ears while his Interior Department worked with Congress to craft a mutually acceptable PLI. Unfortunately the PLI contained numerous ""poison pills"" that made it difficult to advance the bill through Congress before the end of President Obama's term; the following proposed actions are some examples: 1) forbidding designation of any future National Monuments under the Antiquities Act by a sitting president in 7 Utah counties identified in the PLI; 2) circumventing the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals decision regarding disposition of RS 2477 roads by unilaterally granting title of these roads to the state without having to meet criteria dictated by the court; 3) hamstringing federal land-managing agencies ability to manage the public lands by requiring approval of their land-use management plans by county advisory groups prior to implementation; 4) transferring federal responsibility for oil & gas leasing & regulation to the State of Utah.Consequently, the monument was designated as a geological, archaeological, & cultural legacy for all U.S. citizens, & specifically provided the Native Americans with a co-management role. Please don't undo this long-overdue, decent olive branch that has been extended to our Native American citizens. We believe that national monument designations benefit all. Even our State and local politicians grudgingly acknowledge benefits the State of Utah has received from its ""Mighty Five"" national parks, most of which began as national monuments. Furthermore, business communities of Boulder & Escalante, UT have expressed what a boon Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument has been to their respective livelihoods.In summary, my wife & I want public lands including Bears Ears National Monument to remain intact & in public ownership for the benefit of our daughters & grandchildren living in Washington State, & our cousins living in Michigan, Chicago, & Florida. They along with all U.S. citizens (especially Native Americans) are co-owners of all public lands, including Bears Ears & Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monuments.Finally, Secretary Zinke, which legacy would you rather have - one which promotes short-term gain for a few realty & energy promoters, or one that saves a special place for our children & grandchildren & lasts for the ages?",https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=DOI-2017-0002-24887,,Positive,DOI-2017-0002-11291,1k1-8weg-6nhq,5/15/17,43:53.5,FALSE,"Secretary Zinke,I am concerned about the review of federal lands for potential use by companies and ranchers for purposes of profit.The national park lands have been set aside for the American people.

It also provides incredible recreational opportunities for outdoor enthusiasts. Despite its large size, the Monument only barely encompasses its most significant sites. The Monument will be irreparably harmed if any portion of it is de-designated.Given the careful and lengthy process that it took for five native nations and the U.S. to reach an agreement on Bears Ears, the notion that there was insufficient opportunity for stakeholder input on protecting this land is ludicrous.In addition, I find Executive Order 13792 cynical and dangerous. The United States has historically been a major tourist attraction on account of our incredible protected natural landmarks. By rolling back protections on designated Monuments, we would be essentially rendering their federal protection meaningless--reversible by the whim of a given presidency.

This includes places like Grand Canyon National Park, Olympic National Park, Zion National Park and Dry Tortugas National Park. Without the foresight of patriotic Americans wanting to protect these places and bringing the unique cultural, natural and historical heritage to the attention of these presidents, these parks and monuments would not exist. These lands are our lands, this history is our history, the cultures are our culture. The monuments under review have the potential to be as important to as our great National Parks. The Antiquities Act is still relevant and we need to abide by it to preserve our great land.Please respect the importance of the protecting these lands and the Antiquities Act. Many American citizens and then the former Presidents worked to protect these lands as monuments for future generations. The vast majority of legal scholars agree that Presidents cannot rescind or undo designations by previous Presidents without an act of Congress. I think it's your job as Secretary of the Interior to protect America's public lands from the constant pressure of natural resource extraction. America has plenty of other places to mine, drill, log, etc, and we need to protect some sacred places, like the monuments established before and after 1996. The Antiquities Act is unique and innovative and has provided the American people time and time again with cultural, spiritual, and economic rewards that far outweigh gains from short-term extractive uses. Monuments, parks, and public lands contribute mightily to local and national economies, if the local economies let them. The outdoor recreation industry is a $646 billion industry, and in my little area of Colorado alone, public lands help support hundreds of jobs as well as hundreds of thousands of dollars in tourism and business.I would like to remind you of these lines from Teddy Roosevelts's 'New Nationalism' speech, delivered in 1910 but still relevant today:Moreover, I believe that the natural resources must be used for the benefit of all our people, and not monopolized for the benefit of the few, and here again is another case in which I am accused of taking a revolutionary attitude. People forget now that one hundred years ago there were public men of good character who advocated the nation selling its public lands in great quantities, so that the nation could get the most money out of it, and giving it to the men who could cultivate it for their own uses. We took the proper democratic ground that the land should be granted in small sections to the men who were actually to till it and live on it. Now, with the water power, with the forests, with the mines, we are brought face to face with the fact that there are many people who will go with us in conserving the resources only if they are to be allowed to exploit them for their benefit. That is one of the fundamental reasons why the special interests should be driven out of politics. Of all the questions which can come before this nation, short of the actual preservation of its existence in a great war, there is none which compares in importance with the great central task of leaving this land even a better land for our descendants than it is for us, and training them into a better race to inhabit the land and pass it on. Conservation is a great moral issue, for it involves the patriotic duty of insuring the safety and continuance of the nation. Let me add that the health and vitality of our people are at least as well worth conserving as their forests, waters, lands, and minerals, and in this great work the national government must bear a most important part.Thank you for your consideration.

As a resident born and raised in Blanding, Utah I have a vested interest in this conversation. Blanding and the surrounding area is a small, but passionate community; you have the ability to not only declare this land a monument or rescind that declaration, you hold power over the way of life in that place. The people who live on or near monuments understand the effect that they have on the community much better than those who live in distant Salt Lake or Washington DC. We understand that promises to allow our way of life to continue will, sooner or later, be broken.Before this monument became a topic of public discourse, the average Utah'n would have no idea where the Bears Ears, Blanding, or San Juan County were(if they even knew they existed). They have nothing to lose or gain from your actions regarding the monument. If the designation stands they can come down and bike, hike, and camp and appreciate the beauty that is there. If the designation is rescinded they can still do the same. The local residents are the ones adversely impacted. I implore you to listen to those who are actually being affected.Please note that the land is in pristine condition. Why is that? It is because it has been kept out of the public eye which has reduced traffic. The locals have been good stewards of the land as well. There is reason to change something that is working so well.Those who have been pushing so hard for the monument have acted dishonorably. They sling propaganda and lies to further their cause, backed by money (and money to be made or lost based on the designation) and deceit. They stand to gain from the designation of the monument and care nothing about the adverse impact to the residents who occupy the land.One last point; I have visited the many national monuments in Utah and in other places. They are beautiful. The glut of tourism cheapens the experience, however. How can one commune with nature while there is trash, noise, and pictures being taken everywhere? Buses, traffic, and government employees create barriers to enjoying the true beauty of these lands.

I highly doubt ""the people"" have complained that there are way too many national monuments. If the goal is to appease big business, honestly there is more than enough land to go around that can be destroyed by mining. Leave these monuments alone as there is no turning back once they are left to human hands. To add a human element to all this, I happen to live in the shadow of one of these monuments which is on the table for review, San Gabriel Mountains. I can whole heartily say that thanks to this monument, it has allowed the nearby cities of Arcadia, Sierra Madre, and countless other cities to benefit in the many ways. It has helped mold our communities and culture with immediate access to hiking, camping, and many other outdoor activities. It also adds much to our scenery which I know influences property value and the desire for people to move out here. That being said, I know this is not an isolated experience with countless other cities living in harmony by their national monuments. So I ask of you again, please leave these monuments alone. In a country of plenty, surely there is enough land to go around. Unlike the review of the National Monuments, the XL pipeline has been something that people have been asking for help. For months, people have been camping out in the cold to protest the construction of the XL pipeline going through the only water supply for the local natives.

In the 20+ years of its existence many scientific studies and reports have been produced, the body of knowledge about arid ecosystems has been increased immeasurably and the public has had access to the vast array of canyons, slickrock benches, sagebrush plains and lush riparian areas.At the same time private stock raising has continued almost ubchanged since before the designation. This traditional activity has provided a semblance of a living for a few families in Garfield and Kane counties, albeit heavily subsidized by state and federal funds. While it is true that some visitors are entertained by evidence of ""cowboys on the range"" the true value of this activity lies in the potential for improving management of livestock on arid lands. Alas, this has not happened to the extent that it might have, given the influence of some powerful local interests, but it still could. This would require maintaining the acreage on the Monument and allocating sufficient funding and personnel to study and adapt grazing management. Any reduction of acreage would stifle scientific inquiry and potentially lead to increased stocking on the un-designated acres, which would only exacerbate the already significant damage done to the landscape over 100 years ago.I am sending, in a separate email, a US Forest Service report from 1944 entitled The Story of Some Sick Land, which details the effects of over 50 years of overgrazing in the Escalante area. The report deals mainly with higher elevation lands, but of course, activities on the uplands significantly impacts conditions downstream in what is now Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. This report is instructive in that it describes conditions that still exist in the Monument. The only way to keep a ""handle' on this activity is to maintain the Monument intact and improve livestock grazing management.",https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=DOI-2017-0002-135226,,Positive,DOI-2017-0002-110717,1k1-8wlu-d80y,5/26/17,41:20.8,FALSE,"When resources like coal, oil, history, and beauty are used up, they are gone forever.

For most of my growing up years, my father worked underground in a coal mine in Central Utah. After nearly 10 years working underground, his hourly wage was around $14 per hour. As the sole wage earner for a large family, this was not a sufficient wage to cover family expenses and we ended up needing supplemental government support to meet living needs. While many of the recreation industry jobs that will increase as a result of monument designation are also relatively low paying, the economic argument for reducing or eliminating monuments to expand extraction opportunities is not warranted (especially with rising costs for mineral extraction in comparison to other sources of energy).Additionally, the designation of Bears Ears as a National Monument is important to the indigenous people in the United States. The joint management arrangement put in place as part of the monument designation shows respect and aknowledgment of the cultural and religious value of the area to the native inhabitants of the area.We had a chance to vacation in the Bears Ears area last fall prior to the monument designation. We were awed by the beauty and the history of the area and my seven year old daughter is asking to go back and explore more.
